Civil rights group issues travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
The National Association for the Ad@@ v@@ anc@@ ement of Co@@ lo@@ red People has put out an al@@ ert for people of color trav@@ eling to Mis@@ sour@@ i because of the state &apos;s discrimin@@ atory policies and racist attacks .
&quot; The NA@@ AC@@ P Tra@@ vel Advis@@ ory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , effective through August 28@@ th , 2017 , calls for African American travel@@ ers , visit@@ ors and Mis@@ sou@@ ri@@ ans to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when trav@@ eling throughout the state given the series of questionable , rac@@ e-@@ based incidents occurring state@@ wide recently , and noted the@@ rein , &quot; the group &apos;s statement reads .
A recent Mis@@ sour@@ i law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits , as well as the state &apos;s law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities prompted the group to issue the travel al@@ ert , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; You have violations of civil rights that are happening to people .
They &apos;@@ re being pulled over because of their skin color , they &apos;@@ re being beat@@ en up or killed , &quot; the president of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Cha@@ pel , told The K@@ an@@ s@@ as City Star .
&quot; We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven &apos;t heard before . &quot;
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US .
The group cited incidents such as racial sl@@ urs against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Ten@@ nes@@ see .
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while trav@@ eling through the state , and was taken into custo@@ dy by Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
The advis@@ ory also points to a recent report by the Mis@@ sour@@ i Att@@ or@@ ney General &apos;s Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pulled over than wh@@ ites .
&quot; The advis@@ ory is for people to be aware , and warn their families and friends and co-@@ workers of what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; Cha@@ pel said .
&quot; People need to be ready , whether it &apos;s bringing bail money with them , or letting relatives know they are trav@@ eling through the state . &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime reporting program , ranking the state at 16@@ th in the country in terms of the number of such violations .
The travel warning is also a response to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination .
Pre@@ viously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel advis@@ ories for Texas and Ari@@ z@@ ona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to de@@ tain people on immigration violations which the AC@@ L@@ U said would increase racial prof@@ iling .
Tra@@ vel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but lately , advocacy groups have resor@@ ted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US .
After experiencing the “ golden era ” of a soaring box office in 2015 , the film market re@@ treated into a co@@ ol@@ ing-@@ off period in 2016 . Whether box office ta@@ kings could surpass last year ’ s total of RM@@ B@@ 4@@ 4.@@ 0@@ 69 billion is questionable .
Data from the National Bu@@ reau of St@@ atis@@ tics revealed that in October , prices of new and second-@@ hand residential properties co@@ oled , up 0.@@ 6 % and 1.1 % mon@@ th-@@ on-@@ month , respectively .
Lu@@ pe@@ k@@ sc@@ u , the current Chief Technology O@@ ffic@@ er of U@@ E@@ F@@ A , made a technical report on the 2016 U@@ E@@ F@@ A Euro and the last season of European Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ ons League at the meeting .
B@@ BC claims that Beijing has become the most exciting city : making foreigners feel like “ living in a new age ”
Re@@ ference News Net@@ work reported on January 18 that the British media organization has noticed that Beijing is rapidly transforming into a g@@ lam@@ or@@ ous modern city in sp@@ ite of the fact that it is 300@@ 0 years old .
The Chinese capital is interconnected by amaz@@ ingly high-speed Internet and has implemented cu@@ tt@@ ing-@@ edge technologies such as face recognition . It has invested heavily in artificial intelligence and has an un@@ matched capacity of internationalization . It is one of the most exciting cities for foreigners who are eager to explore the world .
According to a report on the B@@ BC web@@ site on January 16 , the German exp@@ atri@@ ate Cle@@ men@@ s S@@ age said : &apos; If I can succeed there , I can succeed anywhere . &apos; He qu@@ oted a s@@ ong written by singer Frank Sin@@ at@@ ra to praise New York City .
S@@ age , who served as Cre@@ ative Director of Tra@@ vel@@ er Ar@@ chi@@ ves , said : &quot; If Sin@@ at@@ ra lives today , he is likely to sing a s@@ ong for Beijing . &quot; He said that living in this city will make you feel like “ living in a new age ” , which means that you can always keep up with the trends .
Sim@@ on Nor@@ ton , who origin@@ ates from England had been living in Beijing in recent years , published an article on personal blo@@ g site 4@@ Cor@@ ner@@ s@@ 7@@ Seas saying : “ People generally have a feeling of being at the center of something grand . Although this feeling is hard to describe clearly , it is the reason why so many foreigners stay there for a long time . They want to see what it will become and hope to witness it . ”
According to reports , the city &apos;s high-quality , high-speed Internet and technolo@@ gy-@@ friendly environment make everyday life easier than ever before .
An@@ dy Pe@@ ñ@@ a@@ fu@@ er@@ te , who origin@@ ates from Man@@ ila and is currently the deputy edit@@ or-@@ in-@@ chief of the web@@ site Beijing Children , said : &quot; Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cash@@ less society . The Internet integ@@ rates the functions of traditional w@@ alle@@ ts into smart phones , making it easier for everyone to conduct various transactions . &quot;
According to reports , smart phones are just the beginning of Beijing &apos;s technical ambitions . F@@ ace recognition technology is being widely used across the city . Many mobile phone applications use this technology to facilitate bank transfers and payments , grant people access apar@@ tments and offices , and even use it to ver@@ ify identity of the drivers providing car@@ -@@ ha@@ iling service .
Beijing recently announced plans to invest 13@@ .8 billion y@@ uan in the construction of an artificial intelligence technology par@@ k . When it is completed , more than 400 companies will settle there . They will focus on the development of artificial intelligence technologies ranging from biome@@ tri@@ cs to self-@@ driving cars .
Food plays a central role in China ’ s many major traditional fes@@ tiv@@ als . Fore@@ igners are enthusiastic about these fes@@ tiv@@ als . The Spring F@@ es@@ tiv@@ al is the most important fes@@ tiv@@ al in both social and economic sense , and it is also one of the most enjo@@ y@@ able fes@@ tiv@@ als for foreigners .
S@@ age said : “ It &apos;s a pleasure for me to help Chinese friends prepare for the New Year . It is equally important to clean the apar@@ tment and pa@@ st@@ e the red spring cou@@ ple@@ ts with blessing words on the door . On New Year ’ s eve , all family members must gather together to have a good me@@ al and stay until mid@@ night , and finally to celebrate the New Year with fire@@ works . For foreigners , spending the night with friends and their family is indeed an opportunity for bl@@ ending . ”
According to reports , a large number of foreigners are living in Beijing and the number is growing . However , the language barrier and the convenience of exchanges between the exp@@ atri@@ ates can easily become exc@@ uses for not fully integrating into the local culture .
S@@ age said : &apos; Some foreigners have lived in China for many years , but they have little experience with their host country . If your initial attempt to interact with the Chinese is not successful , then it is easy for you to feel more comfortable with other foreigners .
In these so-called &apos; foreign bubbles &apos; ( &apos; La@@ ow@@ ai bubble &apos; ref@@ ers to circles in which foreigners only mixed in with foreigners , without tou@@ ching local people and local culture -@@ - transl@@ ator &apos;s note ) , foreigners m@@ ing@@ le with each other in their own communities , eat in Western restaurants , and only make friends with foreigners .
The easi@@ est way to overcome problem is to learn a little bit of M@@ and@@ ar@@ in – something easier than one might think .
S@@ age said : “ One or two hours of private lessons in Chinese every week or learning ent@@ r@@ y-@@ level radio dram@@ as should suit everyone ’ s busy schedule . ”
Even learning a few classic ph@@ ra@@ ses will help with shopping , or@@ dering a me@@ al in a restaur@@ ant , or ch@@ at@@ ting on a tax@@ i .
According to reports , persistent air pollution is also a fact of daily life , but the government has tried to curb pollution in recent years .
Re@@ sidents emphasize that out@@ door activities are very important in warm months when pollution is often light . It is important to consider those blu@@ e sky days as opportunities for ram@@ bling in ancient en@@ cr@@ yp@@ tors or exploring the popular R@@ it@@ an Park .
Nor@@ ton said : &quot; Beijing is a Chinese city that one can find most things below the surface . You can find very good arts and music activities , indul@@ gent night@@ life , historical won@@ ders , ultra-@@ modern business districts and ancient hu@@ t@@ ong areas . &quot;
The report believed that the hind@@ rance to growth in human capital as a result of aging has become increasingly apparent . This was particularly the case in the Northeast , where the annual average contribution of aging to human capital growth was -@@ 1.@@ 28 % .
P@@ an G@@ ong@@ sh@@ en@@ g said that the present of risk of cross-border capital flows can be controlled . The fundamental factors underpinning international balance of payments will still exist over the longer term .

In April this year , the European Commission accused Google of co@@ er@@ cing mobile phone manufacturers into inst@@ alling software such as the Google search engine and Ch@@ ro@@ me web b@@ row@@ ser , or they would not be allowed to use other Google applications .
The European Commission believed that this har@@ med consumer interests and hin@@ dered competition .
EU regulators initially requested that Google make a response prior to July 27 .
If found guilty of violating anti@@ trust rules , Google could face a maximum fine of 10 % of its global tur@@ no@@ ver , or approximately US $ 7.@@ 4 billion .
Google has not made immediate comment on this .
Google also faced EU investigations over giving prominent plac@@ ement to its own shopping services in search results .
Z@@ hang Yun@@ ing &apos;s stay@@ -@@ abroad is a real one . It can be said that his achievement of “ jum@@ ping level ” from the national youth to the national Olympics is by no means accid@@ ental , and his le@@ ap@@ -@@ forward growth is still surprising .
Under@@ stand through a picture : B@@ it@@ coin &apos;s legal status around the world
Ab@@ str@@ act : A part from the price correction which is natural in speculation , the current round of digital currency tum@@ ble has also to do with the &apos; s@@ worn enemy &apos; — regulation .
From the vi@@ su@@ alized m@@ aps , the attitude of the eastern countries towards B@@ it@@ coin is more conservative than that of the West . Most countries in the world are still in@@ decisive about the legitimacy of digital currencies , indicating that the “ risk of the black sw@@ an ” is still looming large .

As the authorities in major markets of B@@ it@@ coin -@@ - such as China , South Korea and the European Union -@@ - take decisive regulatory measures , the digital currency market dominated by B@@ it@@ coin has experienced major bloodshed this week . The price of B@@ it@@ coin has fallen below 10,000 dollar , recor@@ ding the biggest one-@@ day drop .
A part from the price correction which is natural in speculation , the current round of digital currency tum@@ ble has also to do with the &apos; s@@ worn enemy &apos; — regulation .
At this important junc@@ ture , H@@ ow@@ Mu@@ ch@@ .@@ net , a vi@@ su@@ alization big data web@@ site , produced a map showing the legitimacy of B@@ it@@ coin and regulation measure in place in countries around the world .
As shown in the figure below , green represents the legal market for B@@ it@@ coin , and or@@ ange represents the neutral market . Although there is no place where B@@ it@@ coin is acknowledged a legal currency , there are no major restrictions on the use it . The p@@ ale pin@@ k represents the restricted market , i.e. the local government tries to the use of the digital currency pass by drawing a red line or taking regulatory measures . The deep pin@@ k represents countries where B@@ it@@ coin is declared as illegal . The gra@@ y represents countries that have not yet been rated .
( The above figure was drawn by the H@@ ow@@ Mu@@ ch@@ .@@ N@@ et vi@@ su@@ alization team on January 15@@ th )
The article points out that from the distribution of non-@@ green color pat@@ ches in the gra@@ ph , it can be seen that the ori@@ ental countries in the traditional sense are more conservative towards B@@ it@@ coin than the West .
Russia is currently the largest country that defines B@@ it@@ coin as illegal . China is one of the largest restricted markets for B@@ it@@ coin . India is one of the largest countries that have not comm@@ ented on B@@ it@@ coin and have not made relevant policies .
North America and Western Europe are the regions that have highest level of tolerance to B@@ it@@ coin i.e. where green pat@@ ches are concentrated .
The views of the countries in the Middle East and Latin America on B@@ it@@ coin are clearly divided , so , the distribution of color pat@@ ches in these areas is more mixed .
Among them , Iraq , Iran , Turkey and Brazil are all legitimate B@@ it@@ coin markets . Afghanistan , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , Egypt , and Bolivia have some restrictions on the trading and use of B@@ it@@ coin . Most Latin American countries have not made any comments about B@@ it@@ coin .
From the above data , it can be seen that of the 24@@ 6 countries that have been rated , a total of 99 countries ( or 40 % of the total ) haven &apos;t imposed any restrictions on the transactions and use of B@@ it@@ coin . They are represented by green and or@@ ange pat@@ ches .
S@@ even countries ( or 3 % ) are restricted markets ( p@@ ale pin@@ k ) , 10 countries ( or 4 % ) have defined B@@ it@@ coin as illegal ( dark pin@@ k ) , and 130 countries ( or 53 ) % ) haven &apos;t given comments on digital currency ( gre@@ y ) .
This shows that countries that account for the global majority ( 53 % , more than half ) are still in@@ decisive about the legitimacy of digital currencies represented by B@@ it@@ coin . This means that the “ black sw@@ an risk ” is still very large for B@@ it@@ coin , because some of these countries may ultimately make legislation that restrict the use of digital currencies .
The article believes that global regulators have not fully understood the digital currency as a new type of currency . This may be the main reason why most countries have not chosen a stance .
Although B@@ it@@ coin ’ s popularity has grown expon@@ entially since last year , it does not necessarily mean that all countries are interested in it . It &apos;s probably that some countries are concerned that the local currency may be undermined by digital currencies or that digital currencies are used by criminal organizations .
W@@ all@@ stre@@ et@@ c@@ n has published an article sum@@ mar@@ izing the news related to regulation measures against B@@ it@@ coin across the world since last week , including : China starts to crackdown on online platforms and mobile A@@ PP@@ s of over-@@ the-@@ counter exchanges ; South Korea is still considering to close the digital currency exchanges ; the European Union holds the view that B@@ it@@ coin has not yet been widely accepted and war@@ ns investors of the risk of “ losing everything ” .
W@@ all@@ stre@@ et@@ c@@ n E@@ dit@@ or &apos;s selection : Re@@ ading News &#@@ 12@@ 4@@ ; 2018 : Global Central Banks Are U@@ sh@@ ering Digital Currency ? One article points out that 2018 is dest@@ ined to be the first year of digital currency for central banks across the world , viewing from the perspectives of supervision , acceptance / criticism and adoption .
The act of questioning the legal status of B@@ it@@ coin by big countries such as Russia is actually meant to make way for the official issu@@ ance of digital currencies .

Is nothing sacred ?
Now Trump &apos;s White House is targeting the Stat@@ ue of Liber@@ ty
The su@@ rest mark of regime change is when they start attacking the stat@@ ues .
Americans appreciate this as well as anyone - hence the carefully st@@ age-@@ man@@ ged top@@ pling of Saddam Hussein in Fir@@ do@@ s square in Baghdad in 2003 .
Stephen M@@ iller , one of the key ideo@@ lo@@ gues of the Trump regime , surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic ax@@ e to the Stat@@ ue of Liber@@ ty in a heated argument with CN@@ N &apos;s Jim A@@ co@@ sta over the president &apos;s proposals to dra@@ stically limit legal immigration .
In fairness , M@@ iller did not attack the stat@@ ue itself .
A hor@@ de of bo@@ at-@@ trip owners and Liber@@ ty im@@ person@@ ators would have l@@ yn@@ ched him if he did .
But he did attack its meaning , and in particular the meaning as@@ cri@@ bed to it when Em@@ ma L@@ az@@ ar@@ us &apos;s famous po@@ em was added to its base in 190@@ 3 , 17 years after the mon@@ ument itself was completed .
As M@@ iller sc@@ ol@@ ded A@@ co@@ sta : &quot; I don &apos;t want to get off into a whole thing about history here , but the Stat@@ ue of Liber@@ ty is ... a symbol of American liberty ligh@@ ting the world .
The po@@ em that you &apos;@@ re ref@@ erring to , that was added later and is not part of the original Stat@@ ue of Liber@@ ty . &quot;
M@@ iller is fac@@ tually correct , but as he put it himself , this is not really about history .
It is about the contemporary reson@@ ance of L@@ az@@ ar@@ us &apos;s star@@ tling words , the only ones in which a state has appeared to invite not just any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; Y@@ our tired , your poor , / Y@@ our hu@@ ddled masses ye@@ arning to brea@@ the free , / The wre@@ t@@ ched refuse of your te@@ em@@ ing shore . &quot;
There has never been a time when the &quot; wre@@ t@@ ched refuse &quot; has been more visible on our scre@@ ens .
M@@ iller was not engaging in liter@@ ary criticism - he was making it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump &apos;s US@@ A .
This conflict about the meaning of a stat@@ ue is part of a wider political and cultural war : it is really a conflict about the meaning of America .
L@@ az@@ ar@@ us - and her friends who campaigned to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were engaging in a highly political act .
The sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture was intended to mark the connections between French and American re@@ publi@@ can@@ ism by representing in a well-@@ worn classical tro@@ pe , the female embo@@ di@@ ment of Liber@@ ty .
L@@ az@@ ar@@ us changed that meaning : in her po@@ em the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice .
And she gives herself a very different name : M@@ other of Ex@@ iles .
The mar@@ rying of the po@@ em to the image is a brilliant fem@@ inist coup and a devastating attack on American nati@@ vi@@ sm .
And just as L@@ az@@ ar@@ us changed the meaning of the stat@@ ue , righ@@ tw@@ ing@@ ers have long wanted to change it back .
The great lou@@ d@@ m@@ outh Rus@@ h Lim@@ b@@ au@@ gh , a kind of John the B@@ ap@@ tist for the coming of Trump , argued in 2010 that Liber@@ ty is not inv@@ iting anyone in , but is rather an early ne@@ oc@@ on , taking the American fl@@ ame out to the ben@@ igh@@ ted world : &quot; L@@ ady Liber@@ ty is ste@@ pping forward .
She is meant to be carrying the tor@@ ch of liberty from the United States to the rest of the world .
The tor@@ ch is not to light the way to the United States . &quot;
Rather unusually , Lim@@ b@@ au@@ gh actually hit on something .
The meaning of the stat@@ ue is entirely a matter of the ang@@ le of perception .
L@@ az@@ ar@@ us &apos;s great imagin@@ ative act was to see it as it would be seen by exhausted , wre@@ t@@ ched but hopeful people on the dec@@ ks of ships after long and often d@@ read@@ ful jour@@ ne@@ ys .
It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refu@@ ge and a chance to better their lives .
Her stat@@ ue speaks back to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear .
And of course , this is not the perspective M@@ iller and Trump want ever to recogn@@ ise .
Their tor@@ ch is meant not to light the way , but to infl@@ ame the hat@@ re@@ ds that are their only source of power .

World Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships 2017 : Ne@@ il Black p@@ raises Scottish members of Te@@ am GB
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ y@@ le rec@@ alls a time when only two S@@ co@@ ts made the GB team
UK Ath@@ le@@ tics &apos; performance director Ne@@ il Black says the 16@@ -@@ strong Scottish contingent in the World Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships squ@@ ad will make &quot; a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017 , which starts on Fri@@ day .
Black believes &quot; there &apos;s something special evolving &quot; in Scotland and UK athle@@ tics must learn from that .
&quot; We embrace it and we &apos;@@ re trying to understand it and we &apos;@@ ll push on that until we work it out , &quot; Black said .
&quot; I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of S@@ port and they think it &apos;s something to do with what they &apos;@@ ve done .
Scottish Ath@@ le@@ tics think it &apos;s something to do with what they &apos;@@ ve done .
British athle@@ tics : it &apos;s something to do with what they &apos;@@ ve done .
And the gu@@ y on the corner street , too .
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
Several of the Scottish athletes are me@@ dal cont@@ enders , including La@@ ura Mu@@ ir and Andrew B@@ ut@@ char@@ t - who will race against S@@ ir M@@ o Far@@ ah in the 5,000@@ m , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ y@@ le was voted by the squ@@ ad to be team cap@@ tain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is slightly modest .
Her cap@@ tain &apos;s speech was incre@@ di@@ ble , &quot; says Black .
&quot; A number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , wal@@ ked out of that room feeling hugely proud and really motivated .
The passion and real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally put into it were great . &quot;
The Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver me@@ d@@ al@@ list , who will compete in the 400@@ m hur@@ dles at her fifth World Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships , says it &apos;s &quot; incre@@ di@@ ble &quot; 16 S@@ co@@ ts are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s previous best total of athletes at the worlds was seven , achieved in 198@@ 3 and 2015 .
M@@ idd@@ le-@@ distance run@@ ner Mu@@ ir is leading the way , having set five British and two European records in the past year .
She will go in the 1500@@ m and the 5,000@@ m .
Ch@@ ris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs in the 1500@@ m , is another S@@ co@@ t to watch , following a great season that included victory at the British Te@@ am trials and the An@@ ni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ y@@ le re@@ members her first world champ@@ ion@@ ships , when the only other S@@ co@@ t in the team was Lee Mc@@ Con@@ ne@@ ll .
The team cap@@ tain says she &apos;s &quot; hugely proud &quot; of the fact so many of her comp@@ at@@ riots have not only made the team , but , in some cases , will be challenging for me@@ d@@ als and competing to make fin@@ als .
&quot; The special thing about being team cap@@ tain is that it was voted for by the other members of the team , so that it was such a huge hon@@ our anyway but to know that your te@@ amm@@ ates have voted for you and chosen you made it extra@@ -@@ special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; Obviously , I &apos;@@ m very proud of all the S@@ co@@ ts who &apos;@@ ve made the team .
It just shows how far we &apos;@@ ve come .
And they &apos;@@ re here as well-@@ established athletes , athletes that are going to be looking to get on po@@ di@@ ums .
As for my cap@@ tain &apos;s speech ?
Ye@@ ah , I think it went well .
I just drew on the fact that we &apos;@@ re very lucky in this situation in that we &apos;@@ ve got a home World Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships .
So it &apos;s really just the importance of drawing on that home support and thriving on the fact that we &apos;@@ re back at the Olympic Sta@@ di@@ um .
I &apos;@@ m getting a second chance to go out there and compete and it &apos;s just going to be such an amaz@@ ing atmosphere out there . &quot;

B@@ locking critics from Facebook : Don &apos;t run for public office , if you can &apos;t take heat from voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press .
Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long for newspapers to start s@@ lam@@ ming him on everything from domestic policy to his political principles .
He cha@@ fed at the criticism , sure .
But he did not silence his critics .
Because back in 17@@ 8@@ 3 , Washington said , &quot; the freedom of Spe@@ ech may be taken away - and , du@@ m@@ b &amp; silent we may be led , like she@@ ep , to the S@@ lau@@ ghter . &quot;
That brings me to Mar@@ y@@ land Go@@ v@@ . Larry Ho@@ gan , who needs to work on being more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan &apos;s staff has blocked and de@@ le@@ ted the posts of at least 4@@ 50 people who voic@@ ed their opinions on his official Facebook page .
And the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union su@@ ed him for that earlier this week .
The governor &apos;s staff dismissed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was rich with a &quot; who ca@@ res ? &quot; backlash .
&quot; It &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; plenty of fol@@ ks said .
But it matters .
And it especially matters when it &apos;s a gu@@ y like Ho@@ gan .
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state who is astoni@@ sh@@ ingly popular .
He has the second-@@ highest approval rating of the nation &apos;s 50 governors .
Ho@@ gan is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary ho@@ the@@ ad .
He &apos;s shown a steady hand in leading his state and a stern adhe@@ rence to principles .
He &apos;s also been pretty de@@ ft at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constitu@@ ents , pla@@ y@@ fully de@@ bu@@ ting his hair@@ less head after chem@@ o treatments on his page .
So blocking people who come to the governor &apos;s page - which is a public forum , lab@@ eled as official and administered by staff members paid public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
In an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan spokes@@ woman A@@ me@@ lia Cha@@ s@@ se defended the governor &apos;s actions , arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moder@@ ating them .
But it &apos;s too easy to use the image of tro@@ l@@ ls or sp@@ am@@ mers or h@@ ateful fol@@ ks l@@ ashing out online .
The Post talked to some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
And they &apos;@@ re just that - real people talking to their elected leaders : a teacher , a business owner and a pa@@ st@@ or , not tro@@ l@@ ls .
They all said that their comments were respec@@ tful , thoughtful and not prof@@ ane .
The pa@@ st@@ or qu@@ oted the Bi@@ ble in his post , appealing to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
Att@@ or@@ ney L@@ ak@@ sh@@ mi S@@ arm@@ a Ram@@ ani of B@@ ow@@ ie , M@@ d . , wasn &apos;t h@@ ateful , but she asked about hate crimes .
&quot; I poli@@ tely comm@@ ented that I was disappointed in his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news items , &quot; she wrote in the comment section of The Post &apos;s news story .
&quot; I also do not appreciate that idea that when a number of people comment on the same topic , they are immediately dis@@ regarded by some as a so-called collective effort , rather than recognized as a large group of concerned citizens . &quot;
What the governor &apos;s staff called a &quot; concentrated sp@@ am attack &quot; others would probably call &quot; advocacy . &quot;
The Facebook era makes it easy to tail@@ or a message by simply blocking a cri@@ tic or de@@ le@@ ting a negative comment .
It &apos;s a lot cleaner than the old days , when doing the same would have required sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical edit@@ ori@@ als or arre@@ sting and sil@@ encing protesters .
But that &apos;s exactly what &apos;s happening , only dig@@ it@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan isn &apos;t the first public official to be criticized for def@@ ang@@ ing Facebook and other social media .
President Trump is being su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed .
One of the first landmark rul@@ ings on this issue came down last week in Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
The chair of the Lou@@ dou@@ n Coun@@ ty Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors violated the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U@@ .@@ S. Dist@@ ric@@ t Jud@@ ge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alex@@ and@@ ri@@ a , when she banned a constitu@@ ent from her Facebook page .
And in K@@ ent@@ uc@@ ky , Go@@ v@@ . Mat@@ t B@@ ev@@ in ( R ) also got a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U over his use of Facebook and Twitter .
This shouldn &apos;t be so hard .
In Washington &apos;s time , the era of affordable po@@ stage had an impact much like the Internet .
The number of newspapers qu@@ ad@@ ru@@ pled between 17@@ 76 and 18@@ 00 , and an@@ onymous letter writers ham@@ me@@ red his leadership .
And even back then , Washington had an@@ onymous tro@@ l@@ ls .
People using the p@@ se@@ ud@@ on@@ y@@ ms &quot; Ju@@ ric@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ er@@ ius , &quot; &quot; B@@ eli@@ s@@ ari@@ us , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; all wrote let@@ ters to newspapers tra@@ shing Washington &apos;s decisions .
Pe@@ ti@@ tions criticizing his stand on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , Commer@@ ce , and N@@ avi@@ g@@ ation with Britain overwhelmed his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online P@@ apers of George Washington Project .
But he did not silence them .
Freedom of speech , dissent and discourse lie at the very foundation of our nation .
And true leadership means accepting that .
Any movement in the property market would have an impact on the sen@@ sibilities of the general public .
Pur@@ cha@@ se quota is a fixed threshold many cities would adopt when implementing real estate control measures .
In May 2017 , Jin@@ an issued regulations stating that under@@ graduates who make social security contributions con@@ secu@@ tively for half a year will be entitled to be treated under the same residential property purchase policies as that of local residents with permanent resid@@ ency .
In June , W@@ u@@ han issued policies that stipul@@ ate that university students may settle in the city within three years of gradu@@ ation based on their gradu@@ ation cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate and employment permit .
After the policy was enhanced , officials stated that “ university students are entitled to purchase residential property at a 20 % discount to market price ” .
In July , Ch@@ eng@@ d@@ u issue regulations stating that young talent with overseas university bac@@ hel@@ or ’ s degree or higher academic quali@@ fications may apply to settle in Ch@@ eng@@ d@@ u based on their gradu@@ ation cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate .
In addition , K@@ un@@ sh@@ an , L@@ ing@@ ang in Shanghai , as well as other cities or regions also issued relevant “ talent introduction ” policies , and lowered the threshold for buying residential property and settling locally for talents .
Z@@ hang H@@ ong@@ we@@ i believed that this was , in fact , large cities competing for population , particularly talent . Only by retaining population , particularly talent , can a city be competitive . This then , was the key significance of these real estate policies .
Some even believed that this implied that the time has come to aboli@@ sh residential property “ purchase quotas ” .

Z@@ ou S@@ hou@@ m@@ in , Director of the Bu@@ reau of Environmental Super@@ vision of the Ministry of Environmental Protection , said on the 22@@ n@@ d in Beijing that on a nationwide basis , 57 cases were subject to consecutive daily fines . The newly am@@ ended “ Environmental Protection Law ” , implemented at the beginning of this year , has significantly enhanced environmental law enforcement efforts in China .
P@@ res@@ ently , the environmental protection bu@@ re@@ au@@ s across China may use various means of punishment to investigate and deal with conduct in violation of environmental regulations such as impose consecutive daily fines , close down operations and / or di@@ strain , limit or susp@@ end production , and persons held under administrative detention . They will also work together with judicial organs to punish environmental crimes .
Z@@ ou S@@ hou@@ m@@ in said that in August , a total of 3@@ 35 cases were concerned with closing close down operations and / or di@@ strain ; 17@@ 7 cases per@@ tained to limiting or susp@@ ension of production ; 18@@ 9 cases were concerned with persons held under administrative detention ; and 16@@ 6 cases per@@ tained to persons held under suspicion of environmental pollution crimes .
In particular , Hen@@ an imposed consecutive daily fines on seven cases . At present , China is moving from control at the end toward being involved throughout the entire process , intensifying efforts to treat environmental pollution on an all-@@ round basis .
Although pressures from slower economic growth have emerged , China ’ s Ministry of Environmental Protection had already made its position clear ; China should correctly and appropriately position environmental protection in economic growth , and increase “ green determination ” . The more economic growth deceler@@ ates , the more it should hold fast to environmental protection , and ensure that environmental protection plays a positive role in optim@@ izing the economy .

By the middle of this century , China will build a prosperous , strong , democratic , civilized , harmon@@ ious , and beautiful socialist modern power .
This will benefit the Chinese people , and benefit all the peoples of the world as well .
We call on all political parties in the world to work with us to create more opportunities for cooperation for the world , and strive to promote the common prosperity and development of all countries in the world .

Z@@ he@@ jiang Prov@@ ince vigorously promoted the spirit of the Red Shi@@ p , with a firm move to work at the forefront of the times .
A new bat@@ ch of water sam@@ ples were just finished being collected , Liu Ru@@ i and his colleagues were immediately busy .
At the same time as the daily monitoring ,
they are trying to tackle the smart management of rural se@@ wage this year .
How to manage it well , in fact , it is a very serious challenge .
The Institute of E@@ co@@ logy and the Environment , T@@ sin@@ gh@@ ua Y@@ ang@@ t@@ ze River Del@@ ta Research Institute in Z@@ he@@ jiang Prov@@ ince is located in Ji@@ ax@@ ing , the birth@@ place of the Red Bo@@ at spirit .
From nothing more than a dozen years ago to the present ,
the Research Institute of the Y@@ ang@@ t@@ ze River Del@@ ta of T@@ sin@@ gh@@ ua in Z@@ he@@ jiang Prov@@ ince has developed into a platform with three key national level innovations . Nearly 400 overseas students have settled in this region to gather power for innovation in Z@@ he@@ jiang Prov@@ ince .
The spirit of the Red Bo@@ at is a force that we must follow and understand . Innovation is actually very difficult .
There is a lot of frustration behind all innovations in this area ,
none of them can be solved . At this stage , you have to stick to it and keep going .
Pre@@ viously , ordinary people asked for help , but now , officials have come to help . That is
to do real things for the people .
Up to now , in this way , Xia@@ o@@ sh@@ an Dist@@ ric@@ t collected a total of 5,@@ 9@@ 85 issues , of which 3,@@ 8@@ 68 were solved and 1,@@ 4@@ 9@@ 6 were in the process of being handled .
Our agents in Z@@ he@@ jiang Prov@@ ince have a saying that goes
that geographical advantages are inferior to those of the agents , policy concessions are not as good as service ones . The motivation of the Red Bo@@ at spirit dedic@@ ation enables us to make progress and achieve this goal .
They are brave to work .
Recently , the China Feder@@ ation of L@@ iter@@ ary and Ar@@ t C@@ ir@@ c@@ les organized part of the representatives of the 19@@ th NP@@ C from the liter@@ ary and art circle and well-known artists to form a promo@@ tional group and went to In@@ ner Mon@@ go@@ lia , He@@ il@@ ong@@ jiang , G@@ an@@ s@@ u , Shanghai , Guang@@ d@@ ong and Gu@@ iz@@ hou to tour and spread the word of the grand spirit of the 19@@ th NP@@ C .
They went deeply into the grassroots mass art mu@@ se@@ ums , local academ@@ ies and some col@@ leg@@ es and universities in In@@ ner Mon@@ go@@ lia , as well as He@@ il@@ ong@@ jiang and G@@ an@@ s@@ u provinces to conduct a profound interpretation of the new cultural mission
I am deeply proud and happy , and I am willing to go down and write more about the fate of the normal people in the major times .
on the development of grassroots literature and art .
Nowadays mass literature and art are very popular , there is a little popularity ,
and continue to launch quality works worthy of the times .
It should be rooted at grassroots and in-@@ depth lives , with a certain substance of culture that is positive , with long-@@ lasting arti@@ stic works that hold char@@ m .
The actual contracted area has reached 1.@@ 52 billion m@@ u , of which 1.@@ 11 billion m@@ u has been completed .
This accounted for 82 percent of the farm@@ land contracted by second-@@ tier families . 7 provinces and autonomous regions including S@@ ic@@ hu@@ an have completed the report to the Party Central Committee and State Council at a basic level .
It is estimated that by the end of 2018 , the confir@@ mation of the country ’ s contracted land will be completed at a basic level .

This achievement has recently been published in Nature , an international academic journal .
In space , we ob@@ serve that such a new observation that has not been observed before , which cannot be explained or illustr@@ ated by existing theories ,
The significance of this result is diverse . Above all , it shows the ability of Chinese scientists to use the most cu@@ tt@@ ing-@@ edge technologies
to make scientific instruments to pro@@ be a very difficult scientific issue .
F@@ ind the to@@ il@@ et by the no@@ se , in the last century , this is memory that many Chinese are f@@ ond of .
but also incorpor@@ ates more human@@ ized designs .
im@@ pressed so many tourists . The to@@ il@@ et has v@@ enti@@ lation all year around without a peculiar sm@@ ell .
We no longer need to rely on the no@@ se to find the to@@ il@@ et .
We should not only change the hard@@ ware , but the software must also keep up .
The tourism department requires that to@@ il@@ ets at famous sites should be equipped with to@@ il@@ et paper and hand s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ er .
But in some areas ,
Whether to stop this convenient service or not due to the un@@ civilized behavior of individuals
Was decided by managers from all areas who have made their choice .
On the one hand , through civilized promp@@ ts to promote conservation , on the other hand , they also carry out technological innovation .
In public to@@ il@@ ets in places like N@@ anj@@ ing and Su@@ ch@@ en@@ g in Ji@@ ang@@ s@@ u Prov@@ ince ,
by s@@ can@@ ning your face for three secon@@ ds , you can get a free cop@@ y of the to@@ il@@ et paper , but if you want to get double cop@@ ies , you need to wait ten minutes .
This avo@@ ids the abuse of public resources .
habits . Some tourists may indeed think of taking the paper back , but on the other hand , we must reflect on this situation .
Is there paper in the next to@@ il@@ et for tourists to use ? This is what we highlighted in the new three-@@ year plan .
To solve this problem of in@@ adequacy and imbalance
and to push the revolution in to@@ il@@ ets further , we should think more of what the masses think .
to have a third to@@ il@@ et to facilitate family members to ac@@ company the elderly and children to the rest@@ room .
We take our baby to the men ’ s room and we are embarra@@ ssed ,
but when w go to the la@@ dies ’ room , babies are so small that we also feel a bit embarra@@ ssed . That board is particularly comfortable , it is convenient for those who have children .
people feel more civilized and have become civilized buil@@ ders . In the villages , vill@@ agers in H@@ ech@@ i , Guang@@ x@@ i , are creating flu@@ shing to@@ il@@ ets in their homes ,
Great achievements have been made and the active promotion of the to@@ il@@ et revolution does not only help people stay away from disease , but also promotes economic development to narrow the regional development gap .
This to@@ il@@ et problem is an issue of ex@@ pos@@ it@@ ory them@@ es , it is a no@@ de of the social development .
It is a national civilized project that leads from the national point of view to the lay@@ out , and then takes part in all aspects to solve the small social problems with varying degrees of participation .
In this way , we can make up for all shortcomings .

Shanghai introduced pre@@ feren@@ tial policies
It also led a group of innovative talents to stay in the country and stay in Shanghai .
The 19@@ th National Congress of the Communist Party of China first proposed the construction of a modern economic system and demanded that

In the first three quarters of this year , the value of smart manufacturing reached nearly 16 billion y@@ uan , an increase of nearly 40 % over the same period last year . Our original business was
producing the elev@@ ator control system . In the past few years , we clearly felt that the new k@@ ine@@ tic energy of the whole new industry was not enough . Therefore , we
stepped up the transformation and development of this enterprise .
In accordance with General Secretary Xi Jinping ’ s request , Shanghai is spe@@ eding up its march toward becoming a science and technology innovation center with global influence .

We must integrate the idea of carrying forward the spirit of the Red Shi@@ p and deepening the study and public@@ ity of the 19@@ th National Congress and firmly grasp the main idea of Xi Jinping &apos;s thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era .
Make great efforts on learning and ma@@ stering .
We should deepen the study and public@@ ity of the revolutionary spirit , such as the spirit of the Red Shi@@ p , and carry out various forms of educational practice to guide people in actively participating in the great practice of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era .
Before the forum , the participants jointly paid tribu@@ te to the Red Shi@@ p in South L@@ ake .
And they visited the South L@@ ake Revolutionary Mem@@ orial H@@ all .
The General Office of the Central Military Commission recently printed and issued the No@@ tice on C@@ are@@ fully Organiz@@ ing and Le@@ arning Xi Jinping &apos;s Spe@@ ech on the Governance of China , Vol@@ um@@ e II .
It demands that the PLA and the Armed Poli@@ ce Force thoroughly study and understand Xi Jinping &apos;s socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era and raise the spirit of learning , propaganda , and implementation of the 19@@ th National Congress .
The No@@ tice points out that studying and implementing Xi Jinping &apos;s socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era is a major political task of the entire party and army for the present and future .
At all levels , we should have the highest political consciousness and the highest standards and take on the first
and second volume of Xi Jinping : The Governance of China , published previously as the author@@ it@@ ative books in the profound study and understanding of Xi Jinping &apos;s socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era , and the spirit of the 19@@ th National Congress ,
and uni@@ fy it to the major decisions and deploy@@ ments set by the 19@@ th National Congress of the party .
Poverty and Death in Indonesia &apos;s Land of G@@ old
When Bar@@ din@@ a De@@ ge@@ i co@@ o@@ ks din@@ ner , she doesn &apos;t use a sto@@ ve .
She rarely even uses a pot .
In her wo@@ o@@ den home in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of P@@ ani@@ ai reg@@ ency in the res@@ tive Indone@@ sian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually just places a swe@@ et po@@ ta@@ to - known locally as &quot; no@@ ta &quot; - directly into the fi@@ replace .
After half-@@ an-@@ hour , the char@@ red tu@@ ber is re@@ tri@@ ev@@ ed and dev@@ ou@@ red with eager , un@@ w@@ ashed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i s@@ its on the mu@@ d floor - she has no fur@@ nit@@ ure - which is where she also perfor@@ ms her daily ch@@ ores , such as w@@ ashing clo@@ thes with mur@@ ky water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
A buc@@ ket in a ro@@ of@@ less room serves as a lat@@ rine .
As the youn@@ gest of her husband &apos;s four wi@@ ves , she has been as@@ signed no fields to tend .
Pol@@ y@@ gam@@ y is common here .
Of course , working late can be dangerous : Most of the village men are unemployed and many d@@ rink heavily , plus there are the soldiers .
&quot; No one da@@ res to walk around the village after 5 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , &quot; she says .
It &apos;s a rare glimp@@ se of daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch col@@ ony that was absorbed into Indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum , when just 1,@@ 0@@ 26 el@@ ders were forced to vote through a public show of hands before occupying troops .
An existing movement ag@@ it@@ ating for independence against Dutch rule swiftly turned its ire against the J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta government , which maintains tight control over the region , bar@@ ring foreign journalists or rights monit@@ ors .
In 2003 , the province was officially split into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with independent Pap@@ ua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is de@@ sol@@ ate ; the journey here involves a 9@@ 0-@@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to N@@ ab@@ ire , and then a stom@@ ach@@ -@@ chur@@ ning five-@@ hour drive by hire car .
There is no public transport .
The town of some 19@@ ,000 people consists of wo@@ o@@ den houses ring@@ ed by b@@ am@@ bo@@ o f@@ encing , cor@@ rug@@ ated iron ro@@ of@@ s transformed by ru@@ st into varying ta@@ w@@ ny sha@@ des .
V@@ ery few Indone@@ sians have made the journey here , let alone journalists , and practically no foreigners .
Before Christian mis@@ sion@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans wor@@ shi@@ ped a God named U@@ ga Tam@@ e@@ e .
There were other changes , too .
&quot; We were not used to wearing these clo@@ thes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , indicating her vivi@@ dly colo@@ red , hand@@ -@@ wo@@ ven tur@@ ban , dark shir@@ t and a bright sk@@ ir@@ t .
&quot; Before , we only wor@@ e leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and with some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia .
But it is also Indonesia &apos;s land of gold .
The world &apos;s largest and most profitable gold mine , Gra@@ s@@ berg , owned by P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x@@ -based Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an , lies just 60 miles from P@@ ani@@ ai , a high@@ land province around the size of New Jer@@ sey and home to 15@@ 3,000 people .
In 2015 alone , Free@@ port min@@ ed some $ 3.@@ 1 billion worth of gold and copper here .
In addition , Pap@@ ua bo@@ asts tim@@ ber resources worth an estimated $ 78 billion .
These rich@@ es are , however , a source of misery for Pap@@ u@@ ans , ensuring Indonesia &apos;s powerful military maintains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military personnel and units nearly $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 150@@ ,000 to a single officer .
Pap@@ uan calls for greater autonomy threaten this golden go@@ ose , and are dealt with mer@@ c@@ il@@ ess@@ ly .
According to rights activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ u@@ ans have been killed , and thousands more have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned by the Indone@@ sian military since 1969 .
M@@ ass killings in Pap@@ ua &apos;s tribal high@@ lands during the 1970s amounted to genocide , according to the Asia Human Rights Commission .
Indone@@ sian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone .
We Will L@@ ose Everything , a 2016 report by the Ar@@ ch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese of B@@ ris@@ ban@@ e , contains testimony of atrocities committed the previous year , such as extra@@ judicial execu@@ tions , torture - rape and elec@@ tro@@ cu@@ tion are especially popular , according to another report - and the brutal cru@@ shing of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; It &apos;s difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week , &quot; says Andre@@ as Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia research@@ er for Human Rights Wat@@ ch .
The scre@@ ws have tightened as Pap@@ ua &apos;s resources bring an influx of settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia .
The province &apos;s 3.5 million population is 8@@ 3 % Christian , but the demographic is changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia &apos;s populous islands of J@@ av@@ a , Bor@@ ne@@ o , Sum@@ at@@ ra and Sul@@ aw@@ es@@ i .
J@@ av@@ anese war@@ ung can@@ te@@ ens sell fri@@ ed ch@@ ic@@ ken and g@@ ad@@ o-@@ g@@ ado mix@@ ed-@@ vege@@ tables served with pe@@ an@@ ut s@@ au@@ ce .
Local people struggle to compete .
&quot; The migrants started to sell ch@@ ic@@ ken and vege@@ tables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ u@@ ans , &quot; explains A@@ be@@ th You , a 24@@ -year-old P@@ ani@@ ai native who moved to the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura for work .
&quot; It made the native Pap@@ u@@ ans - the m@@ am@@ a-@@ m@@ ama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - lose their market . &quot;
Indone@@ sian President Jo@@ ko W@@ i@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jo@@ kow@@ i , vowed to address the inequalities and rights abuses in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 .
The former car@@ p@@ enter secured 27 of Pap@@ ua &apos;s total 29 districts - including P@@ ani@@ ai - on the way to the Presid@@ ential Pal@@ ace in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta .
But precious little has changed in Pap@@ ua , and today local people feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jo@@ kow@@ i , with the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes for justice to be restored , &quot; You says .
In fact , P@@ ani@@ ai suffered a n@@ adi@@ r just two months after Jo@@ kow@@ i &apos;s October inauguration .
On Dec@@ . 7 , 2014 a group of 11 children were outside sing@@ ing Christmas car@@ ols in front of a bon@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali when two Indone@@ sian soldiers on a mo@@ tor@@ bi@@ ke broke through the g@@ loom .
The star@@ tled children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
One of the soldiers took um@@ bra@@ ge at their tone and later returned with four soldiers , according to local P@@ ast@@ or Ya@@ ve@@ d@@ t Te@@ bai .
The soldiers , who had been drinking , cha@@ sed and beat the group with their ri@@ fle but@@ ts , said victims and wit@@ nesses .
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
One child , 16@@ -year-old Yu@@ li@@ an@@ us Ye@@ im@@ o , was beat@@ en so badly he fell into a com@@ a .
A couple of hours later , the nearby government Election Commission building was set ab@@ la@@ ze , and things escal@@ ated the following day .
About 1,000 young Pap@@ uan men , women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice .
They carried ceremon@@ ial hun@@ ting b@@ ows and performed the wa@@ ita dance - running in circles and simul@@ ating bir@@ d@@ s@@ ong - of Pap@@ ua &apos;s Me@@ e P@@ ago tri@@ be .
Some protesters started hur@@ ling st@@ ones at police and military posts .
As temp@@ ers grew more heated , an order was sent to the soldiers through internal radio : &quot; If the masses offer resistance more than three times , sho@@ ot them dead , &quot; it said , according to an official document seen by T@@ IM@@ E that has not been released to the local media .
Ye@@ re@@ mi@@ as K@@ ay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the Ke@@ go Ko@@ to neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the impending danger and appe@@ aled for calm , im@@ pl@@ oring the crowd to go back home .
Nobody was in the mood to listen .
&quot; When I turned around I suddenly got shot in my left w@@ rist , &quot; he told T@@ IM@@ E on the por@@ ch of his b@@ rightly pain@@ ted wo@@ o@@ den house .
K@@ ay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired but says the bul@@ let came from the ranks of am@@ as@@ sed soldiers .
&quot; It was crowded , many sho@@ ts were fired , &quot; he adds .
Local man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , according to his c@@ ous@@ in who witnessed the sho@@ ot@@ ings .
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him , &quot; Y@@ o@@ han@@ es , who like many Indone@@ sians only goes by one name , told T@@ IM@@ E s@@ om@@ ber@@ ly .
&quot; I saw he was dead ... I k@@ is@@ sed him . &quot;
The Pap@@ ua Poli@@ ce Chief In@@ spec@@ tor General Y@@ ot@@ j@@ e Men@@ de told reporters that his officers were only &quot; securing &quot; their station because it was under attack .
&quot; We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; Pap@@ ua Poli@@ ce spokes@@ person , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ j@@ o Su@@ li@@ sti@@ y@@ o said in 2015 .
&quot; It &apos;s a matter of life and death . &quot;
According to Human Rights Wat@@ ch , five young protesters were killed and many more injured .
News of the killings only fil@@ tered through to J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta the following day .
Three weeks later , Jo@@ kow@@ i gave an impas@@ sioned speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , where he expressed sympath@@ ies with the victims &apos; families and vowed to address the historic abuses in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so it won &apos;t ever happen again in the future , &quot; he said .
Security Minister W@@ ir@@ an@@ to said in October 2016 that he was setting up a non-@@ judicial mechanism to settle historic human-rights violations .
But the exc@@ uses started almost immediately .
&quot; Most of the violations occurred a long time ago .
Some were in the &apos; 9@@ 0s and in early 2000s .
The point is we are committed to addressing these violations , but there are processes to go through , &quot; he said .
Then W@@ ir@@ an@@ to back@@ trac@@ ked when speaking to T@@ IM@@ E in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta on June 5 , saying he has no plans to establish a griev@@ ance mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
Instead , &quot; All will be settled by law , &quot; he said .
W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , who the U@@ .@@ N@@ . has indic@@ ted for &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; relating to more than 1,000 deaths during East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody 1999 independence vote , said that 11 cases of human-rights violations in Pap@@ ua have already been settled , including the P@@ ani@@ ai incident .
Fam@@ ili@@ es of the P@@ ani@@ ai victims gre@@ eted such claims with grim incre@@ du@@ lity .
&quot; I &apos;@@ ve been inter@@ viewed four times for the past three years , but there has been no progress at all , &quot; Y@@ o@@ han@@ es says .
&quot; I &apos;@@ m tired . &quot;
He says that years later , he still lives in fear .
&quot; I &apos;@@ m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; I &apos;@@ m afraid of being arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot;
His brother Y@@ ac@@ o@@ bus echo@@ ed the view that people in P@@ ani@@ ai are fearful of discussing the incident .
He says he was beat@@ en by the military after helping to b@@ ury four of the victims .
&quot; After bur@@ ying the bodies , the military came looking for me , &quot; he says .
The sho@@ ot@@ ings haven &apos;t stopped .
On Tu@@ es@@ day , Indone@@ sian police shot at vill@@ agers in P@@ ani@@ ai &apos;s neighboring D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai reg@@ ency .
One person died and 17 others were wounded , including children , during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manag@@ er of a construction company who refused to help transport an un@@ conscious man to hospital .
The man , 24@@ -year-old R@@ avi@@ an@@ us Dou@@ w who drow@@ ned while he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital .
In@@ cen@@ sed vill@@ agers prote@@ sted in front of the company &apos;s site office .
Poli@@ ce said the vill@@ agers threw roc@@ ks at officers , who responded by firing warning sho@@ ts .
But loc@@ als say the mobile bri@@ gade ( Indone@@ sian param@@ ili@@ tary police ) began shooting at the crowd , killing one .
&quot; We were so pan@@ icked , we are afraid there will be revenge , &quot; 29@@ -year-old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being hur@@ ried in , tells T@@ IM@@ E .
&quot; I have been hiding in my house for two days . &quot;
The D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and the police mobile bri@@ gade to be withdrawn from the area .
P@@ ani@@ ai has always been a trou@@ ble@@ spot for the Indone@@ sian government .
The lack of meaningful development fe@@ eds the discontent of the tribal Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , D@@ ani , and Dam@@ al peoples , who live spra@@ w@@ led across Pap@@ ua &apos;s ver@@ d@@ ant central high@@ lands .
Many joined the Free Pap@@ ua Movement ( O@@ P@@ M ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ u@@ ans by launching s@@ por@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ apping ra@@ ids on Indone@@ sian soldiers .
Some of the top O@@ P@@ M leaders hail from P@@ ani@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Y@@ o@@ gi and Daniel Y@@ ud@@ as Ko@@ go@@ ya .
In response , thousands of people in P@@ ani@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily de@@ tained by the military in recent years , under the gu@@ ise of &quot; safeguarding national sovereignty . &quot;
Some never re@@ appear .
Among the people of Pap@@ ua , P@@ ani@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
Poverty fe@@ eds the discontent .
The little rice on sale in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for loc@@ als to buy .
B@@ read is just as out of reach .
People here grow everything they eat : mainly no@@ ta plus some fruit and le@@ af@@ y vege@@ tables .
F@@ arming is the job of the women , who each can maintain four or five fields of the swe@@ et po@@ ta@@ to .
They usually keep most of the har@@ vest for the family , with the rest sold in the local market .
Ten pieces of no@@ ta cost only 10,000 Indone@@ sian rup@@ iah ( 75 cents ) .
Over time , economic inequalities have grown between the native Pap@@ u@@ ans and the new migrants , who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of a new air routes to N@@ ab@@ ire Air@@ port .
What few jobs exist typically go to the better-@@ educated and wealthier migrants .
Pap@@ u@@ ans rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competi@@ tively .
&quot; The young people are not interested to stay in the village ... because there &apos;s no jobs or money here , &quot; says John G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council of P@@ ani@@ ai .
Is@@ ol@@ ation keeps the world &apos;s eyes off Pap@@ ua .
In addition , reporting restrictions for international media remain tight .
Earlier this year , French journalists Fran@@ ck E@@ sc@@ u@@ die and Basi@@ l@@ le L@@ ong@@ cha@@ mp were de@@ ported from Pap@@ ua for a &quot; lack of coordination with related institutions &quot; despite having been granted rare per@@ mission to film .
According to P@@ he@@ lim K@@ ine , Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Wat@@ ch , Jo@@ kow@@ i &apos;s election campaign pledges to lift reporting restrictions to boost transparency and development have not been realized .
&quot; There are new haz@@ ards for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia &apos;s res@@ tive e@@ ast@@ ern@@ most provinces of Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua : visa denial and black@@ li@@ sting , &quot; he said in a statement .
The lack of press scrutiny means international pressure on the Indone@@ sian government has been largely limited to Pap@@ ua &apos;s immediate neighbors .
In March , six Pacific nations - T@@ ong@@ a , N@@ aur@@ u , Pal@@ au , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands , and the Sol@@ om@@ on Islands - urged the U@@ .@@ N@@ . Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the P@@ ani@@ ai shooting .
These same countries have historically backed the O@@ P@@ M .
Indone@@ sian Foreign Ministry spokes@@ person Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r sh@@ rug@@ ged off the group &apos;s allegations , telling journalists in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta , &quot; In Indonesia , a democratic system still applies and there &apos;s free media so it &apos;s hard for the evidence of human rights cases to be covered up . &quot;
Local people want more foreign governments to take note .
When an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the nation &apos;s human rights ambassador Ke@@ es V@@ an Ba@@ ar , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , local people broke their silence , be@@ se@@ ech@@ ing , &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source who also attended the meeting but who asked to stay an@@ onymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 201@@ 9 , but Pap@@ u@@ ans say they are unlikely to vote again for Jo@@ kow@@ i .
&quot; Jo@@ kow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the P@@ ani@@ ai shooting , &quot; says G@@ ob@@ ai , the tribal council chairman .
He wants Jo@@ kow@@ i to know that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , aside from living under the looming threat of a rap@@ acious military , w@@ allow in de@@ stitu@@ tion , with pal@@ try education and health services .
G@@ ob@@ ai says the P@@ ani@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ u@@ ans , consider their vote to Jo@@ kow@@ i as a &quot; debt &quot; he must repay .
&quot; They don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
Despite the threats and intimid@@ ation , families of the P@@ ani@@ ai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defi@@ ance : bur@@ ying one victim &apos;s body on land just opposite the police and military station .
Know@@ ing that justice may never be served , at least they won &apos;t let those responsible forget their crimes .
&quot; A member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ o@@ bus , head b@@ owed .
&quot; What else could we do ? &quot;
B@@ ran@@ ds such as Su@@ o@@ fe@@ i@@ ya , Ho@@ like and T@@ op@@ strong have leveraged the strength of capital to actively grow their business in the custom@@ ized home fur@@ ni@@ shing industry . On February 10 , 2017 , the China Securities Regul@@ atory Commission ( CS@@ RC ) approved the IP@@ O application of Guang@@ zhou Shang@@ pin Home Coll@@ ection C@@ o . , L@@ t@@ d . , and issued a li@@ sting permit on the Small and Me@@ di@@ um En@@ ter@@ prise Board of Sh@@ en@@ zh@@ en Sto@@ ck Exchange . More than 20 days ago , Op@@ pe@@ in Home Group received approval for its IP@@ O .
Indu@@ stry in@@ siders believed that with the list@@ ings of Shang@@ pin Home Coll@@ ection and Op@@ pe@@ in Home Group , the custom@@ ized home fur@@ ni@@ shing sector , which was already soaring , will turn from production competition to competing for capital .
At the beginning of the new year , when Shang@@ pin Home Coll@@ ection ’ s IP@@ O was first approved , news of the li@@ sting of this classic brand , which represented the custom@@ ized home fur@@ ni@@ shing sector , attracted the attention of the entire home fur@@ ni@@ shing industry .
On the 9@@ th ( Beijing time ) , Re@@ u@@ ters reported that Sam@@ sung Elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ics C@@ o L@@ t@@ d launched its first set of components for autonomous driving and inf@@ o@@ tainment solutions it jointly developed with Har@@ man International on Tu@@ es@@ day . This was a major move by the company to expand into the autom@@ o@@ tive electron@@ ics market .
Sam@@ sung Elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ics acquired Har@@ man International about a year ago .
At the International Consumer Elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ics S@@ how ( CE@@ S ) held in L@@ as Ve@@ gas this week , Sam@@ sung unveiled its autom@@ o@@ tive cam@@ era equipped with colli@@ sion warning , lan@@ e-@@ departure warning , and adap@@ tive cru@@ ise control , which was also developed jointly with Har@@ man .
Sam@@ sung plans to begin shi@@ pping this cam@@ era system , which is built on automatic machine learning and aug@@ mented reality technology this year .
Sam@@ sung also exhi@@ b@@ ited a “ digital coc@@ k@@ p@@ it ” , which allows a car to adapt to the person@@ alized characteristics of the driver even if he or she is not the car owner by acc@@ ess@@ ing the user ’ s information from mobile devices and cl@@ oud .

F@@ ire engul@@ f@@ s Dubai &apos;s &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per for second time
A fire ri@@ pped through one of the world &apos;s tal@@ lest residential tow@@ ers in Dubai on Fri@@ day , forcing hundreds of occup@@ ants to flee the 3@@ 37 me@@ tre@@ -@@ t@@ all , 7@@ 9-@@ st@@ ore@@ y structure .
It &apos;s the second b@@ la@@ ze to swe@@ ep through the high-@@ rise - which happens to be called the Tor@@ ch to@@ wer - in just two years .
The building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , no inju@@ ries were reported , and there was no immediate word on the cause of the b@@ la@@ ze .
&quot; We were sle@@ eping and we wo@@ ke up to the fire alarm and people scre@@ am@@ ing .
We ran down the st@@ airs and it took us about 10 minutes to reach from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; a re@@ sident who gave his name as George told Re@@ u@@ ters .
Dubai &apos;s civil def@@ ence authorities said fi@@ ref@@ ighting squ@@ ads put out the b@@ la@@ ze at around 4.@@ 00 am local time ( 000@@ 0 G@@ M@@ T ) and were co@@ oling the building .
The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected .
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used on the exter@@ i@@ ors of t@@ all buildings across the world .
An investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch after its 2015 fire found that most of the damage was to the cl@@ adding , exter@@ ior pan@@ el@@ ling used for dec@@ oration or insul@@ ation .
In the UK , police have said they believe the system of insul@@ ation and cl@@ adding pan@@ els on London &apos;s G@@ ren@@ fell T@@ ower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire there in June in which some 80 people died .
The Willi@@ ams team also suggested that Mass@@ a might return , even though he had already announced his retirement .
January 9 is just a month away from the P@@ ye@@ ong@@ Ch@@ ang W@@ in@@ ter Olympics . As the Olympic tor@@ ch re@@ lay moves north , war@@ m-@@ ups and intense prepar@@ ations for the Games were carried out . South Korea was warming up for the W@@ in@@ ter Olympics .
Public opinion in South Korea hope that this long-@@ wa@@ ited Nor@@ th-@@ South Di@@ alo@@ g would lead to an “ E@@ aster eg@@ g ” ( nice surprise ) for the coun@@ tdown to the P@@ ye@@ ong@@ Ch@@ ang W@@ in@@ ter Olympic Games .
The W@@ in@@ ter Olympic tor@@ ch arrived in South Korea on November 1 last year .
The fer@@ v@@ or stir@@ red up by the Olympic tor@@ ch is directly reflected on the sale of admission tic@@ kets for the P@@ ye@@ ong@@ Ch@@ ang W@@ in@@ ter Olympics .
A little over two months ago , the proportion of tic@@ kets sold lin@@ ge@@ red at 32 % for the P@@ ye@@ ong@@ Ch@@ ang W@@ in@@ ter Olympics , and a mere 4.@@ 3 % for the W@@ in@@ ter Par@@ aly@@ mp@@ ics . The sluggish tic@@ ket sales caused concern among the outside world about the popularity of the P@@ ye@@ ong@@ Ch@@ ang W@@ in@@ ter Olympics at one point .
However , just as the Chairman of the P@@ ye@@ ong@@ Ch@@ ang Organiz@@ ing Committee for the 2018 Olympic &amp; Par@@ aly@@ mp@@ ic W@@ in@@ ter Games , Lee He@@ e-@@ Be@@ om predicted , “ As the W@@ in@@ ter Olympic tor@@ ch is carried and passed on across South Korea , interest in the W@@ in@@ ter Olympics will rise . I believe that tic@@ ket sales will turn around very quickly ” .
South Korean media reported that as of January 3 , the proportion of tic@@ kets sold for the P@@ ye@@ ong@@ Ch@@ ang W@@ in@@ ter Olympics has reached 64 % , and that for the Par@@ aly@@ mp@@ ics has also exceeded 50 % .
To encourage foreigners to come to watch the Games , South Korea ’ s Ministry of Justice has also announced on the 8@@ th that foreigners who visit the country for the P@@ ye@@ ong@@ Ch@@ ang W@@ in@@ ter Olympics may extend their stay for up to 120 days .
More than 1 in 5 US trav@@ ell@@ ers carry prohibited items onto aircraft , survey finds
A survey of air@@ line passeng@@ ers found that more than 20 per cent had know@@ ingly or un@@ know@@ ingly smugg@@ led prohibited items past the US Trans@@ portation Security Administration chec@@ k@@ points onto the aircraft , including at least 6 per cent who bo@@ ar@@ ded the plane while un@@ int@@ ention@@ ally carrying prohibited k@@ ni@@ ves or other bl@@ aded obj@@ ects .
Less than 1 per cent claimed that they discovered bel@@ atedly that they had mistak@@ enly travel@@ led with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ si@@ ves .
The survey of more than 100@@ 0 people - which was conducted by a je@@ t-@@ char@@ tering service Str@@ at@@ os J@@ et Char@@ ters In@@ c . - also found that younger trav@@ ell@@ ers were more likely to fl@@ out the rules .
Of the respondents who admitted know@@ ingly trying to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , 19@@ .@@ 7 per cent were m@@ illenni@@ als , compared with less than 15 per cent who were members of Gener@@ ation X .
The most common items wh@@ is@@ ked past T@@ SA agents on purpose were food and liqu@@ ids .
More than 3 per cent admitted know@@ ingly carrying bl@@ aded items past security , while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.@@ 7 per cent of male respondents also acknowledged int@@ ention@@ ally carrying prohibited drugs onto the aircraft .
The company said it surve@@ yed trav@@ ell@@ ers around the country to find out how many had accid@@ entally brought contra@@ band through air@@ port security and how many had done so on purpose .
It &apos;s no surprise that the people most likely to haul contra@@ band past security - know@@ ingly or un@@ know@@ ingly - were those who fly the most .
As the company points out , however , the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing .
People are often uncertain of what liqu@@ ids they can carry or how much of them .
So it &apos;s no surprise that the largest amount of stuff seized by the T@@ SA happens to be for@@ b@@ idden liqu@@ ids .
For a time , people thought the T@@ SA might be treating books as contra@@ band .

E@@ PA Chief P@@ ru@@ it@@ t B@@ ack@@ trac@@ ks on Del@@ ay@@ ing Obam@@ a-@@ Er@@ a R@@ ules to Re@@ duce E@@ missions
One day after getting su@@ ed by 15 states , Environmental Protection Agency chief Scot@@ t P@@ ru@@ it@@ t reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obam@@ a-@@ era rules reducing emissions of smo@@ g-@@ causing air pollu@@ tants .
P@@ ru@@ it@@ t presented the change as his agency being more responsive than past administrations to the needs of state environmental regulators .
He made no mention of the legal challenge fil@@ ed against his prior position in a federal appeals court .
At issue is an Oc@@ t@@ . 1 deadline for states to begin meeting 2015 standards for gr@@ oun@@ d-@@ level o@@ zone .
P@@ ru@@ it@@ t announced in June he would delay compliance by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid &quot; interf@@ ering with local decisions or impeding economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ it@@ t , who was O@@ k@@ la@@ hom@@ a &apos;s state att@@ or@@ ney general prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump , has long served as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations .
Since arri@@ ving in Washington , P@@ ru@@ it@@ t has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil-fuel industries .
W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day &apos;s sudden reversal is the latest legal set@@ back for P@@ ru@@ it@@ t &apos;s regulatory rol@@ l@@ back agenda .
Last month , a federal appeals court in Washington ruled the E@@ PA administr@@ ator over@@ stepped his authority in trying to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane lea@@ ks .
In a statement issued W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day ev@@ ening , P@@ ru@@ it@@ t suggested his ab@@ out-@@ face on o@@ zone standards simply reinforced the E@@ PA &apos;s commitment to working with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards on time .
&quot; Under previous administrations , E@@ PA would often fail to meet design@@ ation dead@@ lines , and then wait to be su@@ ed by activist groups and others , agreeing in a settlement to set sched@@ ules for design@@ ation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ it@@ t , who su@@ ed E@@ PA more than a dozen times in his prior job .
&quot; We do not believe in regulation through li@@ tig@@ ation , and we take dead@@ lines seriously .
We also take the stat@@ ute and the authority it gives us seriously . &quot;
Still , the E@@ PA &apos;s statement said P@@ ru@@ it@@ t may at some point once again use his &quot; delay authority and all other authority legally available &quot; to ensure regulations &quot; are founded on sound policy and the best available information . &quot;
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader re@@ write of the o@@ zone rules .
A House bill approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules at least eight years .
The measure has not yet been brought to a vote in the Senate .
New York Att@@ or@@ ney General E@@ ric Sch@@ ne@@ i@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states that su@@ ed the E@@ PA this week , said the group intends to keep up the legal pressure .
&quot; The E@@ PA &apos;s reversal - following our lawsuits - is an important win for the health and safety of those 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers , and the over 11@@ 5 million Americans directly imp@@ acted by smo@@ g p@@ ouring into their communities , &quot; Sch@@ ne@@ i@@ der@@ man said .
New York was joined in the case by California , Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Il@@ lin@@ ois , I@@ ow@@ a , Main@@ e , Massachusetts , Min@@ ne@@ so@@ ta , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia , R@@ ho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mon@@ t and Washington , and the Dist@@ ric@@ t of Columbia .
G@@ r@@ oun@@ d-@@ level o@@ zone is created when common pollu@@ tants emit@@ ted by cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sun@@ light .
The resulting smo@@ g can cause serious brea@@ thing problems among sensitive groups of people , contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year .
Public health advocates and environment@@ alists che@@ ered P@@ ru@@ it@@ t &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; It &apos;s disturbing how much pressure it took to get this common@@ sense step from the gu@@ y in charge of protecting the air we brea@@ the , &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d of the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; We &apos;@@ ve got to keep fighting the Trump administration &apos;s ideological cr@@ us@@ ade to pan@@ der to pollu@@ ters and special interests . &quot;
In addition to the external factor of reb@@ ounding steel prices , enterprises are also forging ar@@ du@@ ously ahead on the path of lowering costs .
As enterprises resume production on a large scale , steel prices have begun to fall .
At present , both China Iron and Ste@@ el Association and the National Bu@@ reau of St@@ atis@@ tics have yet to release June ’ s earnings figures for the steel industry .
Beijing R@@ ail@@ way Administration revealed that rail@@ way transportation for the 2017 Spring F@@ es@@ tiv@@ al will begin on January 13 and end on February 21 , a total of 40 days .
My goal was to learn about the state of artificial intelligence -@@ - where we &apos;@@ re further along than people realize and where we &apos;@@ re still a long ways off .
Y@@ est@@ er@@ day , two land par@@ c@@ els at F@@ ang@@ sh@@ an and D@@ ax@@ ing , offered for ten@@ der on-@@ site , were trans@@ acted for a total of RM@@ B@@ 1,@@ 8@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 2 million .

Since the second half of 2009 , sales ( volume ) of Xia@@ o@@ sh@@ an ’ s f@@ lowering trees and sh@@ ru@@ bs have remained relatively bu@@ oy@@ ant . This Spring in particular , sales of Xia@@ o@@ sh@@ an ’ s see@@ d@@ l@@ ings recorded a historic high . Sal@@ es volume grew significantly and prices jumped . St@@ atis@@ tics revealed that for the first six months of the year , the sales revenue of see@@ d@@ l@@ ings in the Xia@@ o@@ sh@@ an Dist@@ ric@@ t increased by 48 % year-@@ on-@@ year , and the magnitude of the growth rate was the biggest in nearly 20 years .
Shi Hai@@ y@@ ong , Deputy Director of the Xia@@ o@@ sh@@ an Fore@@ stry Bu@@ reau , said that the production of Xia@@ o@@ sh@@ an ’ s f@@ lowering trees and sh@@ ru@@ bs also grown rapidly along with the positive sales trend .
In the last two years , the planting ac@@ re@@ age of Xia@@ o@@ sh@@ an ’ s f@@ lowering trees and sh@@ ru@@ bs have expanded by 30,000 m@@ u , with total area at 180@@ ,000 m@@ u . At the same time , expansion is being actively carried out outside the region . Xia@@ o@@ sh@@ an ’ s farmers have been setting up f@@ lowering tre@@ e and sh@@ ru@@ b bases total@@ ing 80@@ ,000 m@@ u across the country , an increase of 30,000 m@@ u from that in 2008 .
While expanding planting ac@@ re@@ age , the quality of the see@@ d@@ l@@ ings have also continued to improve ; the existing value of the nur@@ series has been rising . More large spec@@ im@@ en and high quality see@@ d@@ l@@ ings have been preser@@ ved , and sellers have been reluctant to sell some see@@ d@@ l@@ ings .
Shi Hai@@ y@@ ong also said that confronted with the current bu@@ oy@@ ant peak production and sales period , producers should cal@@ mly face and obj@@ ectively analyze the situation , and take into consideration that the demand for f@@ lowering trees and sh@@ ru@@ bs is long term and will continue to increase . At the same time , they should also be aware that market competition will intensify .
July 13 morning Beijing Time . US-@@ based Som@@ al@@ tus fil@@ ed a law@@ suit in the U@@ .@@ S. Dist@@ ric@@ t Court for the Eastern Dist@@ ric@@ t of Texas acc@@ using Apple of inf@@ r@@ inging on a bat@@ tery technology patent it applied for in 2010 .
The company had previously used the same patent to sue A@@ sus , Len@@ o@@ vo , Sam@@ sung , S@@ ony and To@@ shi@@ ba .
The law@@ suit claimed that iPh@@ one 6@@ s and Apple equipment similar to it have violated US Pat@@ ent No@@ . 7,@@ 65@@ 7,@@ 38@@ 6 , which is known as “ Inte@@ gr@@ ated bat@@ tery service system ” .
The plain@@ ti@@ ff is seeking monetary dam@@ ages or ro@@ y@@ alties on the inf@@ r@@ inging equipment upon announcement of the verdict .
According to the indic@@ tment , the plain@@ ti@@ ff appears to believe that iPh@@ one ’ s fast-@@ char@@ ging technology j@@ as violated the former ’ s patent .
iPh@@ one ’ s fast-@@ char@@ ging function charges the bat@@ tery quickly until to 80 % of its capacity , then swit@@ ches to slower tric@@ kle char@@ ging .
Som@@ al@@ tus is actually a so-called “ patent tro@@ ll ” because the company does not provide any apparent product or service , and it is hard to find any information on the company online .
However , it has successfully reached out@@ -of-@@ court settlement with auto makers such as For@@ d and N@@ is@@ san with this patent .
The meeting believed that accelerating information development ; promoting inter@@ connection and integration , as well as efficient utili@@ zation of resources ; and enhancing the level of digi@@ tization and intelligence in industry would have great significance for advancing “ M@@ ade in China 2025 ” ; entrepreneurship and innovation by the masses ; developing new drivers ; and raising the standard of living for the masses .
“ At C@@ af@@ é 6 ” , a Taiwanese movie about the relationship of a group of you@@ ths , star@@ ring D@@ ong Z@@ i@@ j@@ ian , is a film competing for the current film fes@@ tiv@@ al ’ s media a@@ ward . “ D@@ e L@@ an ” , another movie in which he is the leading actor , has also been short@@ listed for the Golden G@@ ob@@ let A@@ ward .
The 23@@ -year-old , d@@ ressed in a cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age T@@ -@@ shir@@ t and black swe@@ at p@@ ants , looked young and radi@@ ant . As there were not enough cha@@ irs in the interview room , he sat on the floor and said , “ Let ’ s start . Ch@@ at@@ ting like this isn ’ t half bad . ”
It was earlier revealed that the rail@@ way department would enhance the capacity of and re@@ model the 12@@ 30@@ 6 web@@ site , and launch new services during the Spring F@@ es@@ tiv@@ al transportation tic@@ ket purchase period .

Trump pres@@ sured Mexico on border wall payment according to le@@ aked phone call tran@@ scrip@@ ts
Tran@@ scrip@@ ts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been le@@ aked by the Washington Post .
On 27@@ th January in a phone call to Mexican president , En@@ rique Pen@@ a Nieto , Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a proposed border wall .
The US President ber@@ ated him for publicly den@@ oun@@ cing the wall , reportedly saying to him &quot; You cannot say that to the press . &quot;
Trump launched his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the US southern border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project .
Tran@@ scrip@@ ts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Tur@@ nb@@ ull were also published revealing a tense exchange .
M@@ r Trump told M@@ r Tur@@ nb@@ ull a deal for the US to take on refugees headed for Australia was &quot; ridic@@ ul@@ ous , &quot; &quot; ro@@ tten &quot; and &quot; stupid , &quot; insisting the deal , bro@@ ke@@ red under the Obama administration , would make him look like &quot; a d@@ ope &quot; after he had proposed a ban on refugee re@@ settlement in the US .
M@@ r Trump ended the call after telling M@@ r Tur@@ nb@@ ull &quot; this is the most un@@ pleasant call all day . &quot;
In his Nobel Prize ban@@ qu@@ et speech read by the United States Am@@ bassador to Sweden , Bo@@ b D@@ y@@ lan said that he was out on the road when when he received news that he had won the a@@ ward . “ It took me more than a few minutes to properly process it . ”

Mo@@ ore &apos;s For@@ d Massac@@ re : Ac@@ tivi@@ sts Re@@ enact R@@ ac@@ ist L@@ yn@@ ching as a Call for Justice
A 1948 For@@ d Mer@@ cur@@ y passed through a group of on@@ loo@@ kers in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and rum@@ bled toward the small Mo@@ ore &apos;s For@@ d Bri@@ dge .
Before the car , which had four black passeng@@ ers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men with guns stepped forward to block its path .
The leader of the mo@@ b - a middle aged man in a pin@@ stri@@ ped suit - took a long drag on his ci@@ gar and pe@@ ered through the wind@@ shi@@ eld .
In@@ side , the occup@@ ants re@@ eled in fear .
&quot; We want that n@@ --@@ --@@ r Ro@@ ger ! &quot; the man bar@@ ked .
&quot; G@@ et him out of the car ! &quot;
S@@ cre@@ ams ri@@ pped through the silence as a young black man was dragged from the front passeng@@ er seat .
Fortunately , this horrific scene , which played out on July 22 , is just a re@@ en@@ ac@@ tment .
But when a no@@ ose is thrown around the nec@@ k of &quot; Ro@@ ger , &quot; nearly everyone in the audience let out very real gas@@ ps .
Since 2005 , civil rights activists have returned to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s For@@ d Bri@@ dge to rec@@ reate the night two black couples - Ro@@ ger and D@@ or@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com , and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray D@@ or@@ sey - were l@@ yn@@ ched by the K@@ u K@@ lu@@ x K@@ lan in 194@@ 6 .
No one has ever been charged with the mur@@ ders .
&quot; It &apos;s mind bo@@ gg@@ ling that all of these years , not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities ; even though we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ r@@ one B@@ roo@@ ks , who helps organize the re@@ en@@ ac@@ tment .
&quot; It &apos;s a st@@ ain on a history , but it &apos;s a burden on our sou@@ ls . &quot;
B@@ roo@@ ks is a 7@@ 1-@@ year-old former Georgia state cong@@ res@@ s@@ man and lifel@@ ong civil rights activist .
For him , the re@@ en@@ ac@@ tment serves as a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that an injustice has never been correc@@ ted .
&quot; We want prosecution , we want closure , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but we have to have justice first , &quot; he said .
&quot; We can &apos;t get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice . &quot;
A cor@@ oner places a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore &apos;s For@@ d l@@ yn@@ ching on July 27 , 194@@ 6 .
According to FBI fil@@ es obtained by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the l@@ yn@@ ching .
But not one was ever prosecu@@ ted .
Though the suspects have remained at large for decades , civil rights activists say the twin motivations for the l@@ yn@@ ch@@ ings were always well known throughout town : politics and sex .
In April 194@@ 6 , a Supreme Court ruling enabled black citizens in Georgia to cast bal@@ lots for the first time during the primary race later that summer .
Around the same time of the election , according to the FBI , black sha@@ rec@@ ro@@ pper Ro@@ ger Mal@@ com st@@ ab@@ bed Bar@@ net@@ t H@@ ester , a white land@@ owner , during a fight - ostensibly over a woman .
B@@ roo@@ ks said the town rum@@ or was that H@@ ester had been sle@@ eping with Mal@@ com &apos;s wife , D@@ or@@ oth@@ y , and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband &apos;s .
On July 25 , 194@@ 6 , Lo@@ y Har@@ ris@@ on , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to bail Mal@@ com out of jail , according to the FBI .
He was accompanied to the prison by D@@ or@@ oth@@ y , and their c@@ ous@@ ins , Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George D@@ or@@ sey .
But , driving away from the jail , as they approach@@ ed Mo@@ ore &apos;s For@@ d Bri@@ dge , a l@@ yn@@ ch mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; As it turns out it was Har@@ ris@@ on who set up and ordered the mur@@ ders , &quot; one FBI report concludes .
&quot; It is also apparent that there was a conspiracy among state and local law enforcement , who not only took part in the mur@@ ders , dis@@ posed of evidence and conce@@ aled the identity of wit@@ nesses . &quot;
B@@ roo@@ ks put it more suc@@ c@@ inc@@ tly .
&quot; It was a voting rights massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &apos; If you regi@@ ster and if you vote , this is what will happen to you . &apos; &quot;
For nearly a decade , C@@ ass@@ and@@ ra Green@@ e has directed the annual re@@ en@@ ac@@ tment of the Mo@@ ore &apos;s For@@ d Bri@@ dge l@@ yn@@ ch@@ ings .
Her performance is graphic , gri@@ pping and gr@@ ounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America .
It &apos;s difficult to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Green@@ e said that &apos;s the point .
&quot; We don &apos;t want to talk about the l@@ yn@@ ching because it makes us face the ug@@ lin@@ ess in all of us , &quot; she said .
&quot; But I can &apos;t build a relationship with you , if you won &apos;t hear me , or hear what I &apos;@@ ve been through . &quot;
Re@@ hear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - crowded into a room and list@@ ened as Green@@ e launched into a well-@@ re@@ hear@@ sed over@@ view of the play .
W@@ ade Mar@@ b@@ au@@ gh serves as Green@@ e &apos;s co-@@ director .
He &apos;s played the part of the head K@@ lan@@ s@@ man for years , but he said the role never gets any easier .
&quot; I feel dirty because this is not who I am , &quot; said Mar@@ b@@ au@@ gh .
&quot; But I think it &apos;s very important to keep this history alive because we don &apos;t want to go back to those times . &quot;
Across the room , actors D@@ arri@@ us Bra@@ d@@ sha@@ w and N@@ ick R@@ as@@ con@@ a , who play Ro@@ ger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ net@@ t H@@ ester , re@@ hear@@ sed their lines .
The play begins with Mal@@ com shou@@ ting and sho@@ ving H@@ ester , li@@ vi@@ d that he &apos;s been sle@@ eping with his wife , D@@ or@@ oth@@ y .
&quot; I said n@@ --@@ -@@ a , get off my property ! &quot;
R@@ as@@ con@@ a fires back .
There &apos;s a beat .
And then everyone ( at least all the black actors ) bur@@ sts into lau@@ ghter .
Green@@ e lau@@ gh@@ s the hardest .
&quot; What ? ! , &quot; R@@ as@@ con@@ a asked .
He &apos;s al@@ armed , confused .
D@@ id I go too hard ?
&quot; No , &quot; Green@@ e said through ch@@ uc@@ k@@ les .
&quot; I just don &apos;t think white people back then said &apos; n@@ --@@ -@@ a . &apos; &quot;
&quot; Ye@@ a , &quot; one of the other black cast members qui@@ pped .
&quot; You have to hit the hard &apos; R@@ . &apos; &quot;
And just like that the energy in the room shifts ; a sense of cam@@ ar@@ ad@@ er@@ ie re@@ places the dis@@ comfort .
Everyone is dedicated to getting this right , not only for the sake of the play , but also for the memory of the four people killed .
The scene begins again .
This time , when R@@ as@@ con@@ a says the N@@ -@@ word , it &apos;s sharp and emp@@ h@@ atic .
Ab@@ s@@ olu@@ tely no one lau@@ gh@@ s .
The re@@ en@@ ac@@ tment ends viol@@ ently and quickly .
There &apos;s scre@@ ams , gun@@ fire and then , silence .
A woman d@@ ressed in fun@@ eral black , stands over the actors bodies and perfor@@ ms B@@ illi@@ e H@@ oli@@ day &apos;s m@@ our@@ n@@ ful eu@@ logy , &quot; S@@ tran@@ ge F@@ ru@@ it . &quot;
Her voice breaks on every other word .
A hundred y@@ ards back , a group of about four dozen spec@@ t@@ ators wi@@ pe swe@@ at and te@@ ars away from their eyes .
The audience is almost ev@@ enly split between black and white .
One couple has traveled from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many are from just down the road .
They &apos;@@ ve all wea@@ thered Georgia &apos;s op@@ pressive hum@@ idity for the nearly eight hours as B@@ roo@@ ks lead them on a pil@@ gri@@ m@@ age to the grave sites of the Mal@@ com@@ s and D@@ or@@ se@@ ys .
Up until this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ do@@ te , but now , standing on the same land where the l@@ yn@@ ch@@ ings took place , the air feels ha@@ unted .
As the final notes of the s@@ ong f@@ ade , Green@@ e inv@@ ites the crowd to move closer and insp@@ ect the bodies .
Children c@@ rou@@ ch by their heads , take in the fake blood and still bodies , and wh@@ is@@ per to each other .
&quot; They &apos;@@ re not really dead , &quot; one little boy mut@@ ters , as if to remind himself .
After a few minutes Green@@ e thanks the crowd , and suddenly it &apos;s over .
The actors throw off the l@@ yn@@ ching ro@@ pe and wi@@ pe away te@@ ars .
Bra@@ d@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ b@@ au@@ gh , the man in the suit who played the head K@@ lan@@ s@@ man .
N@@ ick R@@ as@@ con@@ a hu@@ gs two of his cast@@ m@@ ates , and then breaks down c@@ rying in their arms ; the emotional toll of the performance finally getting to him .
&quot; It &apos;s ok@@ ay , &quot; one of the women wh@@ is@@ p@@ ers .
&quot; We know that &apos;s not what &apos;s in your heart .
You did this for a reason . &quot;
Later , the audience s@@ its down to din@@ ner with the actors .
At one table , a white couple from At@@ lan@@ ta ch@@ ats anim@@ atedly about the re@@ en@@ ac@@ tment with a black couple they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ ski struggled to find words for how the performance made her feel .
&quot; It &apos;s hard to hear those horri@@ ble aw@@ ful words , and deeds ... come out of people that look like you and who do it because they look like you , &quot; she said .
&quot; What this really does to me is make me think that l@@ yn@@ ch@@ ings are still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; they &apos;@@ re just called police sho@@ ot@@ ings now . &quot;
Across the room , Ty@@ r@@ one B@@ roo@@ ks holds court at his table , eating and reminis@@ cing about civil rights .
He said he &apos;s already begun planning for next year &apos;s performance .
&quot; The re@@ en@@ ac@@ tment is inspir@@ ational in a way because it describes the hor@@ ror of what we endured , but it also is a teaching moment , &quot; he said .
&quot; It &apos;s like , if you don &apos;t learn from this , it can happen again .
Those who don &apos;t study their history , those who do not know their history , are doomed to repeat it . &quot;
As regards implementing market-oriented reforms associated with natural gas , the importance of reform with respect to “ pipeline and grid independence ” is self-@@ evident , but more resistance and controversy can be expected .
On the 7@@ th , reporters learned from K@@ ail@@ uan ( Group ) that at 11 : 25 am on the 7@@ th , an explosion occurred at the emul@@ si@@ fying work@@ shop of K@@ ail@@ uan ( Group ) Ch@@ em@@ ical C@@ o . , L@@ t@@ d@@ . which is located at Gu@@ y@@ e Dist@@ ric@@ t of T@@ ang@@ sh@@ an , He@@ be@@ i Prov@@ ince ; 13 operators were trapped at the site of the explosion .

US media : Scientists from the Air Force Eng@@ ine@@ ering University of China looking into las@@ er satellite to clean up space deb@@ ris
Re@@ ference News January 18 report US media claims that Chinese scientists have put forward a dar@@ ing and innovation proposal - to use large las@@ ers to clean up the messy Earth or@@ bit , and destroy old satelli@@ tes as well as other space deb@@ ris .
A January 15 report on US “ New@@ s@@ week ” web@@ site stated that researchers at the Air Force Eng@@ ine@@ ering University of China have written a thesis on “ Research on de-@@ or@@ b@@ iting model of small scale space deb@@ ris removal using sp@@ ac@@ e-@@ based las@@ er ” . This thesis described how by using sp@@ ac@@ e-@@ based platform las@@ ers , space deb@@ ris would be rendered smaller and less dangerous as a result of las@@ er radiation .
The report claimed that for years , space deb@@ ris has always been a matter of concern for international space agencies . NASA has considered many alternative plans to track , pro@@ be and remove human made deb@@ ris .
The methods for clean@@ ing up large space deb@@ ris include using an enormous net to clean up and collect the deb@@ ris , as well as using mag@@ ne@@ tic material to suc@@ k them out of the or@@ bit . Chinese scientists have conducted a las@@ er simul@@ ation study and arrived at the following conclusion . This will be an effective method for clean@@ ing up the Earth ’ s or@@ bit .
The abstract of the thesis claimed that “ ( the simul@@ ated study ) has provided the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space deb@@ ris removal by using sp@@ ac@@ e-@@ based las@@ er . ”
A 2014 research conducted by US defense industry giant Loc@@ k@@ heed Martin revealed that as far as or@@ b@@ iting satelli@@ tes are concerned , approximately 200 deter@@ rents exist daily .
The high-speed deb@@ ris of or@@ b@@ iting satelli@@ tes are regarded as serious threats to future space missions , and have been described by European Sp@@ ace Agency experts as a “ series of fatal threats ” . High-@@ speed deb@@ ris has continued to rise annually over the years .
According to a January 17 report on the US-@@ based “ Pop@@ ular Mechan@@ ics ” web@@ site , space is basically empty , but space around Earth has become increasingly crowded . Every satellite we send into space will ultimately become deb@@ ris or@@ b@@ iting Earth . As time passes , these deb@@ ris will accumulate .
As deb@@ ris increase , the probability of a satellite that is still operating normally being hit by deb@@ ris becomes higher , thereby damaging or destroying an investment worth millions of US dollars .
The report claimed that all space agencies have formul@@ ated plans to remove space deb@@ ris in the future .
NASA is considering firing atmo@@ spheric gases to reduce the speed of the deb@@ ris so that it would de-@@ or@@ bit . Europe is looking at launching a satellite with a large net to capture the deb@@ ris and it back to earth . Japan ’ s idea is to use a power chain to capture the deb@@ ris .
At this time , China has also put forward a method of solving the space deb@@ ris problem , and that is , to use a large las@@ er to shrink the floating space deb@@ ris into smaller , less harmful pieces .
According to a thesis published in German magazine “ Op@@ tics ” , a group of researchers at the Air Force Eng@@ ine@@ ering University of China claimed that inst@@ alling such a las@@ er on a satellite would be enough to effectively clean up space ; at least , according to the simul@@ ated results , that is .
The report claimed that the only way to prove effectiveness is to carry out tests . Currently , there are no arrangements for such as mission , but sooner or later , someone will inst@@ all a las@@ er on a satellite and send it into space .
Once this is achieved , we can finally bid fa@@ re@@ well to space deb@@ ris problems for good .

P@@ ear@@ son cuts another 3,000 jobs , sl@@ ash@@ es dividend to revive business
British education group P@@ ear@@ son said on Fri@@ day it would cut another 3,000 jobs and s@@ lash its interim dividend by 72 per cent as it started another restructuring program@@ me to tackle the pressures facing its business .
The job cuts , which Chief Executive John F@@ all@@ on said will mostly come late in 2018 and in early 201@@ 9 , are in addition to 4,000 roles lost in its previous restructuring .
P@@ ear@@ son announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million p@@ ounds ( $ 39@@ 4-@@ million U@@ .@@ S. ) in May in a third cost-@@ cutting program@@ me to try to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning .
The company , which agreed to sell its stake in P@@ eng@@ u@@ in Ran@@ dom House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ s@@ mann last month , said its outlook for the year was unchanged after it reported a 1 per cent rise in underlying sales in the first half to 2.@@ 0@@ 5 billion p@@ ounds .

K@@ abu@@ l con@@ voy attack : Na@@ to soldi@@ er killed in suicide b@@ last
A suicide bom@@ ber has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital , K@@ abu@@ l , killing a Na@@ to soldi@@ er and w@@ ounding several others , officials say .
Five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter were injured , a Na@@ to statement said .
Un@@ confirmed local reports say three civilians also died in the incident in the city &apos;s Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ h district .
The bombing is the latest violence to have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tu@@ es@@ day more than 30 people were killed in a mo@@ s@@ que b@@ last in Her@@ at .
On Mon@@ day a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in K@@ abu@@ l .
A Na@@ to statement said that Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day ev@@ ening &apos;s b@@ last happened when a joint pat@@ ro@@ l with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; person@@ ne@@ l-@@ borne im@@ provi@@ sed explosive device . &quot;
The statement said that all those injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bag@@ ra@@ m air@@ field .
Cor@@ respondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as so-called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ h is a major source of concern to Na@@ to forces based in nearby Bag@@ ra@@ m .
According to the United Nations , Afghanistan saw at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in the first half of 2017 , with about 20 % of those in the capital .
At the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of K@@ abu@@ l .
The Taliban said they had carried out that attack .
On 31 May , a huge bombing in the cent@@ re of the city killed more than 150 people , the dead@@ liest militant attack in the country since US-led forces ou@@ sted the Taliban from power in 2001 .
The violence under@@ lines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weigh@@ s up whether to increase the number of US troops ai@@ ding the military and police in the country .
Cor@@ respondents say the suicide bombings in K@@ abu@@ l in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and in particular the reputation of President Ash@@ raf G@@ hani .
E@@ PA re@@ vers@@ es decision to delay smo@@ g rule after lawsuits
The U@@ .@@ S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed a decision to delay an Obam@@ a-@@ era rule requiring states to curb smo@@ g-@@ causing emissions , one day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency over the move .
The E@@ PA announced the decision to go ahead with the so-called &quot; 2015 O@@ zone De@@ si@@ g@@ nations &quot; late on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day , saying it showed the agency &apos;s commitment to working with states .
&quot; We believe in dialogue with , and being responsive to , our state partners , &quot; E@@ PA Chief Scot@@ t P@@ ru@@ it@@ t said in a statement .

The position stated by National Development and Reform Commission officials as regards achieving the emission reduction target of the 11@@ th Five-Year Plan ahead of time gives the steel industry , which has been subjected to power supply and production quotas , strong expectations of resumption of production .
Although steel plants , as of now , have yet to receive clear no@@ tification from local governments announcing that work related to energy conservation and emission reduction has ended , the industry expects that by around December 15 , 2010 , steel plants nationwide that have been subjected to production quotas will resume production suc@@ ces@@ sively . Ste@@ el prices could start to come under pressure .
A spokes@@ person from a private steel enterprise in He@@ be@@ i told our repor@@ ter that notice to end power supply and production quotas has yet to be received at this time , but in reality , pressure on all enterprises have eased significantly when compared to that in September and October .
Some local governments in He@@ be@@ i Prov@@ ince have repeatedly issued documents related to power supply and production quotas , and have adopted mandatory power shut@@ down measures to limit production .
The repor@@ ter learned from local enterprises that the steel plants of most regions in He@@ be@@ i have resum@@ ed production at this time , and pressure from production quotas have eased .
My@@ ste@@ el@@ .@@ com analy@@ st Z@@ hang T@@ ie@@ sh@@ an estimated that end@@ -@@ user demand for construction steel will gradually weaken as winter has already arrived in Northern China .
C@@ ou@@ pled with the energy conservation and emission reduction program winds down , most steel plants will generally resume production by around December 15 . Produc@@ ts will gradually make their way to markets across the country before New Year ’ s Day .
The increase in the supply of resources will exert some pressure on soaring steel prices .

New results of Sweden &apos;s asylum age assessment tests released
The latest results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden subjected to a new method of medic@@ ally assessing their age show that over 80 percent tested were judged to be older than 18 , but not everyone has faith in their accur@@ acy .
Sweden &apos;s national Fo@@ ren@@ sic Medic@@ ine Agency ( R@@ ä@@ tt@@ s@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ ver@@ ket ) started carrying out the tests earlier year .
They are designed to make age assessment during the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency ( Mig@@ ration@@ s@@ ver@@ ket ) was criticized for fail@@ ings in assessing the correct age of some refugees claiming to be under@@ age .
To date Mig@@ ration@@ s@@ ver@@ ket has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to be tested , and the Fo@@ ren@@ sic Medic@@ ine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period between m@@ id March until July 31@@ st , 2017 .
E@@ igh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged to be 18 or over , while in a further 25 cases the Fo@@ ren@@ sic Medic@@ ine Agency judged that the subject was &quot; possibly 18 or over . &quot;
In 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 . &quot;
The tests are only carried out in cases where the person &apos;s age is in question .
According to Jo@@ han G@@ ö@@ ran@@ ss@@ on from the Fo@@ ren@@ sic Medic@@ ine Agency , the results are consistent with previous months .
&quot; We see no big difference in the statistics from previous months , the numbers are quite consistent , &quot; he told The Local .
The high proportion of cases judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum see@@ ker lied about their age .
In May , the agency released the results of 58@@ 1 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 instances that &quot; suggest the person examined is 18 years or older . &quot;
When newspaper S@@ ven@@ s@@ ka D@@ ag@@ b@@ la@@ de@@ t investig@@ ated the 58@@ 1 results released however it found that in 24@@ 3 of the cases the person had openly stated that they turn 18 this year .
The method of medical age assessment , which consists of taking X@@ -@@ ra@@ ys of wisdom te@@ eth and M@@ RI sc@@ ans of k@@ ne@@ e jo@@ ints , then having d@@ enti@@ sts and radio@@ logists analy@@ se them , has also been critici@@ sed in some quarters .
One s@@ cep@@ tic is Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ s@@ ka Institute en@@ doc@@ rin@@ o@@ logist Claude Mar@@ c@@ us , whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through pu@@ ber@@ ty earlier or later than usual .
&quot; I &apos;@@ ve had reason to think about this , and I don &apos;t think the type of measu@@ rement being used should be .
Jud@@ ging biological age in this way is very uncertain .
If we can &apos;t say it for sure we shouldn &apos;t pretend that we can , &quot; he told newspaper Me@@ tr@@ o .
The Fo@@ ren@@ sic Medic@@ ine Agency &apos;s G@@ ö@@ ran@@ ss@@ on defended the accur@@ acy of the tests however : &quot; In general you can say that the risk of in@@ accurately judging a child to be an adult is small .
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18 , in which case it &apos;s around 10 percent . &quot;
West Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a governor announ@@ ces he &apos;s swit@@ ching parties
The Democratic governor of West Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , Jim Justice , announced Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day night at a rally with President Trump that he &apos;s swit@@ ching parties .
&quot; Like it or not like it , the Democrats wal@@ ked away from me , &quot; Go@@ v@@ . Justice said .
&quot; Today I will tell you with lots of pra@@ yers and lots of thinking ... today I will tell you as West Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ ans , I can &apos;t help you anymore being a Democratic governor . &quot;
The rally erupted in che@@ ers .
&quot; So tomorrow , I will be changing my regi@@ stration to Republican , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; As a co@@ ach , I would tell you it &apos;s time to run another play . &quot;
M@@ r. Trump promised earlier a big announcement at the West Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a rally .
M@@ r. Trump won West Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a by 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the Democratic nominee , Hillary Clinton .
Justice , who is the only billionaire in the state , according to For@@ bes , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes notes that he ow@@ ns coal mines in five states , having inherited a coal business from his father .
He &apos;s worth about $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
Meanwhile , the Republican National Committee released a statement Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day night saying &quot; Governor Justice &apos;s party switch is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather obstruc@@ t than work to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; With only 15 govern@@ or@@ ships and control of the fe@@ west state legis@@ lat@@ ures in history , Governor Justice &apos;s announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is lead@@ er@@ less from top to bottom and unable to find a positive , uni@@ fying message , &quot; R@@ N@@ C cha@@ ir@@ woman R@@ on@@ n@@ a Mc@@ Daniel said in a statement to CB@@ S News .

Co@@ e p@@ raises &apos; can@@ did &apos; Russian apo@@ logy for d@@ oping scandal
Global athle@@ tics bo@@ ss Se@@ bas@@ tian Co@@ e praised what he described as a can@@ did apo@@ logy from Russia over a d@@ oping scandal on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day but reiterated it was not the moment for the country to be read@@ mitted to the sport .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics bo@@ ss Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ y@@ lak@@ h@@ tin told an IA@@ A@@ F Congress , held on the eve of the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships , that his country &apos;s ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight d@@ oping .
He said he was sor@@ ry to &quot; all athletes who have had gold and silver me@@ d@@ als s@@ nat@@ ched from them at competi@@ tions . &quot;
Despite his comments , the IA@@ A@@ F Congress voted in favor of maintaining the ban , imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-@@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) report found evidence of state-@@ sponsored d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very can@@ did response today , a very can@@ did present@@ ation , &quot; IA@@ A@@ F president Co@@ e told reporters .
&quot; The whole Council and the whole Congress was ple@@ ased ... that the Russian federation recognized themselves that they have been through some pretty tor@@ rid times and are doing everything possible to make sure the federation is re@@ engineered . &quot;
Co@@ e said he was also &quot; ple@@ ased &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress is being made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this was not the moment to rein@@ state Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; We need to do everything over the next few months to normali@@ ze this situation .
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the tainted system , &quot; he added
N@@ inete@@ en Russian athletes will be competing as neutr@@ als at the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships which start in London on Fri@@ day , having met strict IA@@ A@@ F criteria .
The head of the IA@@ A@@ F &apos;s T@@ ask Force , R@@ un@@ e An@@ der@@ sen , said on Mon@@ day that Russia had yet to meet several of the criteria for rein@@ statement .
D@@ rug@@ -@@ testing was still insufficient and banned co@@ aches were still operating freely , he told reporters in London after a present@@ ation to the IA@@ A@@ F Council .

Ten@@ cent Financial News on January 18 , the US@@ D@@ -to-@@ RMB middle prices is registered at 6.@@ 4@@ 40@@ 1 , a depreciation of 66 basis points compared with the last trading day , ending the rise sp@@ an@@ ning five consecutive days .
In the overnight market , the US dollar experienced a V@@ -@@ shaped reb@@ ounded , ending at 9@@ 0.@@ 8@@ 900 as of 0@@ 7 : 30 , Beijing time .
The Be@@ ig@@ e Bo@@ ok published by Federal Reserve shows that almost all 12 Fed regions reported mild to moderate growth in economic activity in early 2018 . The Federal Reserve remains optimistic about the outlook for this year .
Meanwhile , the U@@ .@@ S. unemployment rate remained at 4.@@ 1 % in December , the lowest since 2000 , and companies are expected to increase wages in the coming months .
Fed officials generally believe that tax reform is a factor supporting this modest strengthening of the economic outlook . The Fed predic@@ ts that the economy will increase by 2.5 % in 2018 and the interest rate will be raised three times .
Some market observers have point out that the expected tightening of ECB ’ s monetary policy pu@@ shes up the exchange rate of the Euro in recent days . As a result , the US dollar index declines continu@@ ously , and the RMB exchange rate against the US dollar has seen a surge in prices . However , the European Central Bank is unlikely to adjust the policy stance soon . After the short-term fluctu@@ ation of the foreign exchange market , the exchange rates will eventually return to a level dict@@ ated by the fundamentals , and the continued smooth operation of the RMB exchange rate is a high probability event .
It is worth noting that , as the market expects a more stable renminbi , the attractiveness of renminbi assets to foreign investors will also gradually increase .

At 7.@@ 50 am today ( March 10 ) , a chemical plant in Xin@@ x@@ i@@ ang Coun@@ ty , Hen@@ an Prov@@ ince , explo@@ ded , with black smo@@ ke b@@ il@@ lowing at the scene .
The Beijing News repor@@ ter learned from the Xin@@ x@@ i@@ ang Coun@@ ty Party Committee Pro@@ p@@ ag@@ anda Department that one person was injured in the explosion .
The vide@@ os released by local ne@@ tiz@@ ens showed that th@@ ick smo@@ ke was b@@ il@@ lowing at the scene of the explosion , accompanied by no@@ ise .
Some ne@@ tiz@@ ens claimed that the explosion occurred this morning , and that it occurred at a chemical plant in Xia@@ o@@ ji T@@ own , Xin@@ x@@ i@@ ang Coun@@ ty , Hen@@ an Prov@@ ince .
The Beijing News repor@@ ter learned that the chemical plant which explo@@ ded was Hen@@ an Xin@@ x@@ i@@ ang Li@@ ut@@ ong Industrial C@@ o . , L@@ t@@ d .
Public information revealed that the af@@ o@@ res@@ aid enterprise was incorporated in Fe@@ bur@@ ay@@ r 2002 , and its scope of business included the manufac@@ ture of chemicals .
This after@@ no@@ on , Xin@@ x@@ i@@ ang Coun@@ ty Party Committee Pro@@ p@@ ag@@ anda Department responded to the incident . The explosion occurred at 7.@@ 50@@ am@@ . The fire is now effectively under control . One person was slightly injured . The cause of the explosion is still under investigation .
A Beijing News repor@@ ter noticed that in 2015 , the chemical plant in question was exposed by the media including Hen@@ an TV St@@ ation for contam@@ ination in violation of the law .
That day , 8@@ 5-@@ year-old Y@@ o@@ ji Y@@ am@@ ada , the original director of “ What a W@@ on@@ der@@ ful Fam@@ ily ! ” fle@@ w to Beijing to visit the set personally .
News published by the CS@@ RC on February 10 , 2017 stated that the IP@@ O applications of 12 enterprises were approved according to stat@@ ut@@ ory procedures . The af@@ ore@@ mentioned enterprises and their respective under@@ writers were requested to confirm the timing of the issu@@ ance with the Shanghai and Sh@@ en@@ zh@@ en stock exchanges separ@@ ately , as well as to publish their li@@ sting pro@@ spec@@ t@@ uses .
Beijing Business Today reporters found Guang@@ zhou Shang@@ pin Home Coll@@ ection C@@ o . , L@@ t@@ d . ( he@@ rein@@ after referred to as Shang@@ pin Home Coll@@ ection ) , which was targeted for a li@@ sting on the Small and Me@@ di@@ um En@@ ter@@ prise Board of the Sh@@ en@@ zh@@ en Sto@@ ck Exchange , to be among the 12 .
According to the latest published pro@@ spec@@ tus of Shang@@ pin Home Coll@@ ection , the company , incorporated in 2004 , is registered in Guang@@ zhou , and is primarily engaged in the manufac@@ ture and sale of person@@ alized and custom@@ ized panel fur@@ nit@@ ure for an entire home .

On December 26 , reporters learned from the municipal environmental protection bu@@ reau that L@@ u ’ an City successfully declared a total of 98 national and provincial environmental protection projects of various categories , and received special environmental protection funds worth a total of RM@@ B@@ 14@@ 5.@@ 26 million .
In particular , 55 were national-@@ level environmental protection projects , for which special national environmental protection funds of RM@@ B@@ 13@@ 2.@@ 46 million were received ; 43 were provin@@ ci@@ al-@@ level environmental protection projects for which special provincial environmental funds of RM@@ B@@ 12@@ .8 million were received .
It is understood that the projects built involved many areas including comprehensive treatment of regional water environment ( including protecting the ecological environment of W@@ ab@@ u L@@ ake ) , environmental protection of drinking water sources , comprehensive remedi@@ ation of rural environment , prevention and control of pollution at large-scale livestock and pou@@ l@@ try farms , pollution treatment of industrial enterprises , and demonstrations of construction of ecological cities .
The projects , upon implementation , had a positive effect on advancing L@@ u ’ an City ’ s regional scientific development , achieving rehab@@ ili@@ tation for la@@ kes , accelerating improvement in the water environment of dra@@ in@@ age bas@@ ins , ensuring safety in drinking water , and advancing energy saving and emission reduction .
Today , four groups including T@@ ong@@ lu Coun@@ ty , Z@@ he@@ jiang Prov@@ ince , which contributed to Be@@ au@@ tiful China won the 8@@ th China Environmental A@@ ward .
Est@@ abli@@ shed in 2000 , the China Environmental A@@ ward is the most presti@@ gious a@@ ward in the field of environmental protection in China . The judging panel is made up of many Central government departments .
Li We@@ i , head of the judging panel and Secretary-General of China Environmental Protection Foundation said that China is now confronted with legacy ecological issues from a growth model that was GDP@@ -@@ heavy and environmental protec@@ tion-@@ light for a few decades .
The selection of the current China Environmental A@@ ward was aimed at hon@@ oring entities and individuals that have contributed to improving the environment and people ’ s livelihoods so as to reflect popular will .
As far as the judging panel was concerned , T@@ ong@@ lu Coun@@ ty in Z@@ he@@ jiang Prov@@ ince which was founded on the basis of eco@@ logy should win this honor .
According to popular vote , the voice of US actor Morgan Fre@@ em@@ an will be used for J@@ ar@@ vis , the domestic AI hel@@ per Facebook CEO Mark Z@@ uc@@ ker@@ berg built himself .

How soccer &apos;s financial rules impact N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move to Paris
R@@ ules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European soccer clubs will not disrupt N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s world-@@ record transfer from Spain &apos;s Bar@@ cel@@ ona to France &apos;s Par@@ is@@ -@@ S@@ ain@@ t Ger@@ main .
Any consequences will come further down the line for Paris S@@ ain@@ t-@@ Ger@@ main from U@@ E@@ F@@ A , the governing body over@@ seeing the European game which has the power to ban teams from the presti@@ gious Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ ons League t@@ our@@ nam@@ ent .
Financial F@@ air P@@ lay rules launched by U@@ E@@ F@@ A in 2011 mean that P@@ S@@ G will eventually have to show that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s transfer was funded without incur@@ ring huge losses .
Bar@@ cel@@ ona has been paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( $ 26@@ 2 million ) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and N@@ ey@@ mar will command a salary that will run to tens of millions of dollars a year .
Here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move to France .
P@@ S@@ G can certainly stum@@ p up the cash to sign N@@ ey@@ mar and add him to a gal@@ a@@ xy of other stars , given the team &apos;s funding from the energy-@@ rich ruling family of Qatar .
Clu@@ bs are allowed to spend heavily on acquiring players but they have to counter@@ balance that with legitimate sources of income , allowing them to approach break@@ -@@ even on their foot@@ b@@ all-@@ related business .
F@@ F@@ P was conceived by Michel P@@ lat@@ ini after his election as U@@ E@@ F@@ A president in 2007 .
The former France player believed that clubs who ran up huge debts in their pursuit of success were effectively che@@ ating and risking ru@@ in if banks or owners withdrew their support .
In 2011 , F@@ F@@ P shifted from focusing on clubs &apos; debts to monitoring their losses instead .
The change meant that the business model Roman Ab@@ ra@@ mo@@ v@@ ich initially used at Ch@@ el@@ sea in 2003 - buy a club with potential , and then spend heavily to improve the squ@@ ad and build a global brand - become a tougher proposition .
During the current three-@@ year F@@ F@@ P assessment period that runs through 2018 , clubs can inc@@ ur losses of 30 million euros .
And despite P@@ lat@@ ini being ou@@ sted in disg@@ race from the presidency in 2015 , his U@@ E@@ F@@ A successor Ale@@ k@@ san@@ der C@@ ef@@ er@@ in is still committed to de@@ terr@@ ing excessive spending .
&quot; Certainly F@@ F@@ P is not dead and we will , for sure , reinforce the rules going forward , &quot; Andre@@ a Tra@@ ver@@ so , who over@@ sees F@@ F@@ P at U@@ E@@ F@@ A , told The Associ@@ ated P@@ ress last week .
Although P@@ S@@ G will have paid N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s bu@@ y@@ out clause in one lu@@ mp sum , it can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the length of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five-year deal , so the transfer fee could be shown as a 4@@ 4.@@ 4 m@@ illi@@ on-@@ euro cost in the annual accounts for the next five years .
The first wave of F@@ F@@ P sanctions in 2014 saw P@@ S@@ G , along with Abu D@@ ha@@ bi@@ -@@ owned Manch@@ ester City , hit with the heavi@@ est sanctions .
P@@ S@@ G was handed a fine of 60 million euros ( then $ 82 million ) - that was later reduced to 20 million euros - and ordered to limit its Cha@@ mp@@ i@@ ons League squ@@ ads to 21 players for the 201@@ 4-@@ 15 season instead of the normal 25 .
U@@ E@@ F@@ A is on the loo@@ k@@ out for clubs who might try to outw@@ it its financial regulators by infl@@ ating their income through companies linked to a club &apos;s owners .
While a Qat@@ ari company could spon@@ sor P@@ S@@ G , if the value of the spon@@ sorship was deemed to exceed standard market rates U@@ E@@ F@@ A would not allow it to count as legitimate income .
That is what happened in 2014 when U@@ E@@ F@@ A ruled that the value of the Qatar T@@ ou@@ rism Authority spon@@ sorship of P@@ S@@ G was inflated .
It has been reported that part of N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s P@@ S@@ G earnings could come via payments from the 20@@ 22 World Cup organizing committee in Qatar .
But P@@ S@@ G and Qatar 20@@ 22 have denied that N@@ ey@@ mar will become a World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver would be easy for U@@ E@@ F@@ A &apos;s regulators to expose .
P@@ ast sanctions s@@ lap@@ ped on P@@ S@@ G means that U@@ E@@ F@@ A will be even more watch@@ ful of any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
U@@ E@@ F@@ A has not been in pre-@@ emp@@ tive discussions with P@@ S@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s transfer , people familiar with the situation said Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day .
They spoke to The Associ@@ ated P@@ ress on condition of an@@ onym@@ ity as they were not authorized to discuss the P@@ S@@ G situation .
The last published accounts show that P@@ S@@ G made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 201@@ 5-@@ 16 on a tur@@ no@@ ver of 5@@ 4@@ 2.4 million euros .
Ac@@ counts for the last financial year are yet to be published .
P@@ S@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s arrival to be a boon for spon@@ sorship deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and j@@ er@@ sey sales .
The club expects tur@@ no@@ ver would grow by at least 30 percent on the back of the signing .
Clearly ir@@ rit@@ ated to see one of soccer &apos;s biggest players leaving , the Spanish le@@ ague tried to sty@@ mi@@ e N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move , claiming that P@@ S@@ G will be bre@@ aching F@@ F@@ P .
&quot; It is a clear case of &apos; financial d@@ oping &apos; , with the club and the state , &quot; La L@@ ig@@ a President J@@ avi@@ er Te@@ bas told Spanish newspaper AS , ref@@ erring to Qatar &apos;s ultimate ownership of P@@ S@@ G .
Ar@@ sen@@ al manag@@ er Ar@@ sen@@ e W@@ eng@@ er , whose club is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ on , shares La L@@ ig@@ a &apos;s reser@@ v@@ ations about a state funding a club .
&quot; It is the consequence of the own@@ erships and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; W@@ eng@@ er said Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day .
&quot; Once a country ow@@ ns a club , everything is possible .
It becomes very difficult to respect the Financial F@@ air P@@ lay because you can have different ways or different interests for a country to have such a big player to represent a country . &quot;
S@@ mart inter@@ active robo@@ t develop@@ er Ro@@ k@@ id received new investment ; T@@ em@@ ase@@ k is the lead investor
In recent years , start-@@ ups in the AI sector have continued to be a hot favorite of capital .
AI Ro@@ k@@ id recently completed a round of funding , led by T@@ em@@ ase@@ k . Other investors included Credit Su@@ is@@ se , CD@@ IB ( the investment arm of China Development Financial Hol@@ dings C@@ o . , L@@ t@@ d . ) , and existing shareholder ID@@ G Capital .
It is understood that the size of this round of funding was approximately US $ 100 million . Both Credit Su@@ is@@ se and CD@@ IB were first time investors in China ’ s domestic AI industry .
Ro@@ k@@ id is a develop@@ er of smart inter@@ active robots , and is committed to robo@@ tics research . It products can control smart devices in the home , and has continuous autonomous learning and growth functions . It also features recognition , compreh@@ ension and feedback functions .
Pro@@ ce@@ eds from this round of funding will be used for R &amp; D , talent recruit@@ ment , strategic push and industry chain investment lay@@ out .
Ro@@ k@@ id previously raised US $ 8.@@ 3 million in August 2014 in the An@@ gel Round from ID@@ G , L@@ ine@@ ar V@@ ent@@ ure , M@@ fund and Vi@@ sion Capital . In October 2014 , the company again received at least US $ 10 million in Ser@@ ies A funding led by Wal@@ den International , with the An@@ gel investors as participants . On November 1 , 2016 , Ro@@ k@@ id completed Ser@@ ies B funding , led by Ad@@ van@@ tech Capital ; other investors included ID@@ G , M@@ fund , Vi@@ sion Capital and Wal@@ den International .
At the time , Ro@@ k@@ id claimed that after the Ser@@ ies B funding , the company ’ s valuation would reach US $ 4@@ 50 million .
In May 2017 , Ro@@ k@@ id unveiled its consumer class smart voice robo@@ t “ Ro@@ k@@ id - Pe@@ bble ” , integrating AI and the home , priced at RM@@ B@@ 1,@@ 3@@ 99 .
This robo@@ t uses speech syn@@ thesis , natural language understanding , speech recognition technology and micro@@ phone array technology , with convers@@ ational , music broadcast and smart home features .
It has won two major CE@@ S a@@ wards - T@@ ech For A Better World and Home Au@@ di@@ o / V@@ ide@@ o Com@@ ponents And Ac@@ cess@@ ories , as well as Germany ’ s i@@ F De@@ sign A@@ ward , known as the O@@ sc@@ ars of the design world .
At the 2018 CE@@ S which had just ended , Ro@@ k@@ id unveiled another new product : the consumer class aug@@ mented reality A@@ R gl@@ as@@ ses Ro@@ kid@@ Gl@@ ass .
These gl@@ as@@ ses are used as independent head disp@@ lays , and do not require connections to smar@@ t@@ phones or external computers . It is expected to be commer@@ ci@@ alized in 2018 .

During the period of de@@ activ@@ ation , data and information previously stored in i@@ C@@ l@@ oud by users will still remain in i@@ C@@ l@@ oud , and will not be lost .
If users wish to use i@@ C@@ l@@ oud services after February 28 after de@@ activ@@ ation , they must first accept the new terms and conditions to ensure that their accounts are re@@ activ@@ ated and transferred to Gu@@ iz@@ hou@@ -@@ C@@ l@@ oud .
Meanwhile , Apple emphasized in its statement that , “ Apple has a strong data privacy and security mechanism and will not create a back@@ door in any of our systems . ”
i@@ C@@ l@@ oud ’ s main data center at Gu@@ i-@@ An New Area will be the first data center Apple has set up in China . On completion , it will be used to store the data of Apple users in China .
When completed and commis@@ sioned , Chinese users will be able up@@ load and down@@ load data without having to undergo long-@@ distance transmission between China and the US . Spe@@ ed will be enhanced and delays reduced .

“ T@@ of@@ u ” , a 3@@ D anim@@ ated feature film designed for a general audience held its premi@@ ere in W@@ u@@ han on the 25@@ th . Z@@ ou Y@@ i , Director of “ T@@ of@@ u ” , Men@@ g Z@@ hi@@ hu@@ i , An@@ im@@ ation Director of “ T@@ of@@ u ” , as well as To@@ m Di@@ sher , film s@@ ound@@ track com@@ pos@@ er and Em@@ my A@@ ward winner were present to share their beh@@ in@@ d-@@ the-@@ scenes story of the film ’ s creation .
“ T@@ of@@ u ” is based on a traditional al@@ lusion concerning Liu An , Prince of Hu@@ ain@@ an in the H@@ an D@@ yn@@ asty - “ Liu An made a mistake and invented to@@ f@@ u ” . It is an account of “ D@@ ou F@@ u ” , the leading character , a bean who mirac@@ ul@@ ously took on human form , how he over@@ came numerous difficulties and per@@ se@@ vered in his dream to become an im@@ mor@@ tal . This ad@@ orable anim@@ ated film about becoming an im@@ mor@@ tal is closely connected with Hu@@ be@@ i ’ s local culture .
W@@ ud@@ ang Moun@@ tains , located in Shi@@ yan , Hu@@ be@@ i Prov@@ ince , is a UNE@@ SCO World Her@@ itage S@@ ite , as well as the place of origin of To@@ a@@ ist culture and W@@ ud@@ ang mar@@ tial arts . It is known as “ a unique scen@@ ic spot since ancient times , and the premi@@ er cele@@ sti@@ al mountain in the world ” .
Director Z@@ ou Y@@ i revealed that he and his creative team traveled to W@@ ud@@ ang Moun@@ tains to conduct research for the film prior to its creation .
He said that the story of “ T@@ of@@ u ” occurred during the reign of Em@@ peror W@@ u of Western H@@ an D@@ yn@@ asty , against the backdrop of Liu An , Prince of Hu@@ ain@@ an , making p@@ ills to at@@ tain im@@ mortality . The leading character “ D@@ ou F@@ u ” was a bean that mirac@@ ul@@ ously took on human form by accident while Liu An was making these p@@ ills .
In addition to W@@ ud@@ ang Moun@@ tains , the place of origin of To@@ a@@ ist culture , Hu@@ be@@ i Prov@@ ince is also closely connected with the ch@@ im@@ e - a traditional mu@@ sical instrument with long history in China .
In a recent international conference , experts forecast that robots with AI will enter people &apos;s be@@ dro@@ oms in 25 years , and provide various services for humans .

No@@ stal@@ gia Go@@ es Nic@@ he in &quot; W@@ et H@@ ot American Sum@@ mer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de De@@ tec@@ tive &quot;
So this it@@ eration of the story is simultaneously nostal@@ gic for the charac@@ ters &apos; &apos; 8@@ 0s gl@@ ory days ; for the &apos; 9@@ 0s gr@@ un@@ ge era ( around when the master@@ minds David W@@ ain and Michael Sh@@ ow@@ alter made the ske@@ t@@ ch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) ; and for itself - that is , for 2001 , before its stars , like Elizabeth Banks , A@@ my Po@@ e@@ h@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d , went on to bigger things .
As a cultural arti@@ fact , it &apos;s both a sen@@ dup and embo@@ di@@ ment of our Face@@ boo@@ k-@@ enabled era of permanent reminis@@ c@@ ence .
But as a franch@@ ise , it feels like it &apos;s running out of time .
&quot; First Day of Cam@@ p &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of its absur@@ di@@ st hum@@ or ( it included an origin story for a talking can of vege@@ tables , voic@@ ed by H@@ . J@@ on Ben@@ j@@ amin ) .
By doubling down on the core ga@@ g - middle-@@ age actors playing hor@@ ny kids coming of age - it made the im@@ possibility of recap@@ turing the past part of the jo@@ ke .
&quot; Ten Years Later , &quot; with its adults now playing adults , is less emo@@ tionally rooted and its par@@ o@@ dy more sc@@ at@@ ter@@ shot , including a ri@@ ff on &apos; 9@@ 0s stal@@ ker f@@ lic@@ ks like &quot; The H@@ and That R@@ oc@@ ks the C@@ ra@@ dle . &quot;
At one point a character rum@@ m@@ ages through an Apple Pow@@ er@@ book , some in-@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; a bun@@ ch of other things from 1991 . &quot;
Many of the core stories are the same .
S@@ wee@@ t-@@ hear@@ ted Co@@ o@@ p ( M@@ r. Sh@@ ow@@ alter ) , now a no@@ ve@@ list , still hasn &apos;t gotten over K@@ ati@@ e ( M@@ argu@@ er@@ ite More@@ au ) .
Vic@@ tor ( K@@ en Mar@@ ino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ in@@ ity .
And there &apos;s another bat@@ ti@@ ly vil@@ lain@@ ous plot involving Ronald Reagan ( also M@@ r. Sh@@ ow@@ alter ) , now ab@@ et@@ ted by George H@@ . W. Bush ( a well-@@ in@@ hab@@ ited impression by Michael I@@ an Black ) .
As always , the best part of the franch@@ ise is the dig@@ res@@ sions .
It &apos;s especially fu@@ n to see the fore@@ ver@@ -@@ young M@@ r. Rud@@ d , s@@ porting Mat@@ t D@@ ill@@ on &apos;s soul pat@@ ch from &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former big@@ -@@ man-@@ on-@@ camp An@@ dy now feels like a ge@@ e@@ zer .
It &apos;s the moments of random lun@@ acy that might power this franch@@ ise on , like a kind of recur@@ sive &quot; S@@ even Up ! &quot; series , until it reaches what I assume will be its logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et H@@ ot American Sum@@ mer : Twenty Years Later , &quot; whose last scene will have the gang going to see the movie premi@@ ere of &quot; W@@ et H@@ ot American Sum@@ mer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de De@@ tec@@ tive &quot; on Amazon , meanwhile , appeals to a different brand of nostalgia : the Cold War revi@@ v@@ alism of &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; Atomic B@@ l@@ on@@ de &quot; and even &quot; G@@ L@@ O@@ W , &quot; with its East versus West w@@ rest@@ ling ic@@ on@@ o@@ graphy .
The com@@ edy , created by Bri@@ an G@@ ate@@ wood and A@@ less@@ and@@ ro Tan@@ ak@@ a , with R@@ h@@ ys Thomas direc@@ ting , pur@@ ports to be found TV : a Rom@@ an@@ ian 1980s bud@@ d@@ y-@@ co@@ p drama about two B@@ uc@@ ha@@ rest officers fighting for truth , a@@ the@@ ism and the Marx@@ ist@@ -@@ Len@@ inist way .
The lead roles - hard-@@ bo@@ iled G@@ reg@@ or and ide@@ alistic I@@ ose@@ f - are played by Flor@@ in Pi@@ er@@ sic J@@ r. and Cor@@ ne@@ li@@ u U@@ lic@@ i , their dialogue dubbed in English by Ch@@ an@@ ning T@@ at@@ um ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gor@@ d@@ on-@@ Lev@@ it@@ t .
It &apos;s a brilliant idea .
But it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
There are some fine sight gag@@ s ( the police pass the time watching chess on TV as Americans might football ) .
And the ro@@ ster of famous voic@@ e-@@ over actors - among them J@@ en@@ ny S@@ late , N@@ ick O@@ ff@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë S@@ evi@@ gn@@ y - makes for a decent game of spo@@ t-@@ the-@@ voice .
But &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de De@@ tec@@ tive &quot; is so committed to the ver@@ isi@@ mili@@ tude of a ham@@ f@@ ist@@ ed propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mas@@ k is involved - that it often plays like one .
At six long episodes , it dra@@ gs , and the com@@ edy isn &apos;t fast or frequent enough .

The fic@@ tional Rom@@ an@@ ian cre@@ ators were not wrong : We even do it with our own recent history , and theirs .
Re@@ porters learned from recent inter@@ views that the performance of the steel , rail transport , shi@@ pping ves@@ sel , machinery manufac@@ ture and other industries has fallen in general ; some have even incurred losses .
Some experts believed that under the present circumstances , a new round of revit@@ alization of the industries in Northeast China will not only concern the nation ’ s current economic recovery , it will also have an impact on the long-term growth and international competitiveness of China &apos;s manufacturing sector . Hence , there is an urgent call for adjustments and structural transformation to take place .
Tra@@ ditional industries saw a general decline in performance , and even incurred losses . The raw material industry , and the heavy machinery and equipment manufacturing sector saw performance decline significantly , and even incurred losses . These were the first signs from the industries in Northeast China amid the current sluggish economy .
When the economy deceler@@ ated in the past , low-@@ end and primary commodities were the most significantly affected . In the current economic fluctu@@ ation however , both high@@ - and low-@@ end industrial products of Northeast China ’ s traditional industries were affected .
A few years ago , An@@ steel Group ( W@@ ei@@ bo ) began by adjusting its product mix , and gave priority to developing high-@@ end steel pl@@ ates such as those for contain@@ ers , rail@@ road trac@@ ks , shi@@ p@@ building , and civilian home appli@@ ances . However , sales of these product categories fell significantly . In particular , the sales volume of steel pl@@ ates for shi@@ p@@ building plunged 50 % year-@@ on-@@ year .
Ang@@ ang Ste@@ el Comp@@ any ( Ha@@ o Q@@ ing@@ sh@@ un , Director of the Me@@ t@@ all@@ ur@@ gical Department of Li@@ a@@ oning Prov@@ in@@ cial Indu@@ stry and In@@ form@@ ati@@ zation Commission , said that met@@ all@@ ur@@ gy was the third largest pillar industry in Li@@ a@@ oning , with annual steel production capacity of 60 million ton@@ nes , ranked third nationwide .
For the first five months of this year , crude steel production in Li@@ a@@ oning Prov@@ ince amounted to 2@@ 1.@@ 54 million ton@@ nes . Sal@@ es of products required by projects that were encouraged by national policy and where there was strong local government construction activity was better . Produc@@ ts in which market competition was more intense fell by a larger magnitude . This was another characteristic of Northeast China ’ s manufacturing sector .
In sharp contrast to being di@@ li@@ gent and responsible on reaching adul@@ tho@@ od , Daniel W@@ u was a very mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous child , even rebelli@@ ous .
The movie “ Once Up@@ on a Time ” , soon to be released on August 4 , held a press conference entitled “ people from all cor@@ ners of the world have come to meet you ” to launch the movie in Beijing yester@@ day . On@@ -@@ scre@@ en “ B@@ ai Y@@ e couple ” Y@@ ang Y@@ ang ( Y@@ e ) and Liu Y@@ i@@ fe@@ i ( B@@ ai ) were present at the conference .
Y@@ ang Y@@ ang , who under@@ went sur@@ gery on his right e@@ ar just a few days ago , made an appearance for the first time after his rec@@ u@@ per@@ ation . He interpreted his character as someone who “ does not wear his heart on his sle@@ eve ” , quietly giving his all to B@@ ai Q@@ ian , and conce@@ aling all his feelings .
Y@@ ang Y@@ ang said that he had to rou@@ se all his emotions to con@@ vey the character ’ s hidden sad@@ ness to the audience . “ This was certainly a new challenge for me as an actor . While acting this character , I was so emo@@ tionally suppressed that I almost suffered internal inj@@ ury ” .
Liu Y@@ i@@ fe@@ i , meanwhile , revealed that while acting her character in the movie , she cri@@ ed so much that she collapsed at one point .
The Japanese Olympic Committee recently said that the Japanese delegation was targeted at 30 gold me@@ d@@ als at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and making Japan into the To@@ p Three .
In October last year , Chairman Y@@ am@@ ash@@ ita T@@ asu@@ h@@ iro of the Ath@@ le@@ tes Commission of Japanese Olympic Committee expressed his expectation that the Japanese athletes can win 2.5 times more gold me@@ d@@ als at the Tokyo Olympics than at the Rio Olympics .
At the 2016 Rio Olympics , Japanese delegation ranked 6@@ th in the G@@ old Li@@ st with 12 gold me@@ d@@ als .
The representatives formed their own grou@@ p@@ ings , and wal@@ ked to the ven@@ ue holding umb@@ rel@@ las .
Tra@@ ffic on the roads surrounding the ven@@ ue remained normal . There were no ballo@@ ons or slogans at the ven@@ ue , nor a red car@@ pet ; disp@@ lays of plants and fresh flow@@ ers were absent as well .
Y@@ est@@ er@@ day , the second session of the fourth People ’ s Congress of Gu@@ ang ’ an City convened without much ado .
On entering Guang@@ An International Convention and Ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion Center , slogans were absent from the ven@@ ue , and there were no te@@ a cu@@ ps ; not even a bo@@ ttle of min@@ eral water was present .
Instead , there a simple ban@@ ner , a meeting place , a simple rec@@ y@@ cl@@ able paper document ba@@ g containing materials for the meeting and a rec@@ y@@ cl@@ able paper c@@ up for te@@ a or water .
The meeting materials were less den@@ se than that of the past . A few pieces of paper sum@@ mar@@ ized the theme and the agenda of the meeting .
“ Be thri@@ fty for the people . Those whose duty are to be fru@@ gal must live fru@@ g@@ ally . A return to the current simple and down@@ -to-@@ earth meeting environment , we fully comprehend and welcome it . ” Guang@@ An People ’ s Congress deputy W@@ ang Chen@@ g said that an efficient and practical meeting without formali@@ sm is what they want to see and in which they want to participate .
Experts pointed out that both inflationary and deflationary pressures have eased at this time . This was undoubtedly good news for the financial and economic structural transformation stage .

Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after lack@@ lu@@ str@@ e economic growth and easing inflation dam@@ pen@@ ed speculation over a hike .
The Bank of England has warned economic growth will remain &quot; sluggish &quot; as it kept interest rates on hold amid a tightening squeeze on family incomes .
Policymakers on the Bank &apos;s Monetary Policy Committee ( M@@ PC ) voted 6-@@ 2 to keep rates at 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members this month calling for a rise as lack@@ lu@@ str@@ e economic growth has weakened support for a hike .
In its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank cut its forecasts for growth to 1.7 % in 2017 and 1.6 % in 2018 and cau@@ tioned the squeeze on household incomes would continue , with inflation still expected to surge close to 3 % in the autumn .
But it sign@@ alled rate hikes will be needed over the next few years to rein in Brex@@ it-@@ fuel@@ led inflation and said borrowing costs may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets .
M@@ emb@@ ers also voted to withdraw part of the m@@ am@@ mo@@ th econom@@ y-@@ boosting package unleashed a year ago in the aftermath of Brexit .
It will call time on the Ter@@ m Fun@@ ding Sch@@ em@@ e to offer cheap@@ -@@ finance to banks from next February , although it said it was now expected to offer £ 15 billion more under the scheme - at £ 11@@ 5 billion .
In minutes of the rates decision , the Bank said : &quot; In the M@@ PC &apos;s central forecast , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains sluggish in the near-@@ term as the squeeze on households &apos; real incomes continues to weigh on consumption . &quot;
On rates , it reiterated that &quot; some tightening of monetary policy &quot; would be needed to cool inflation and by a &quot; somewhat greater &quot; extent than markets expect .
Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
But the Bank stressed that any hikes would be &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot;
The Bank &apos;s down@@ gra@@ ded growth forecasts for this year and next compare with the 1.9 % and 1.7 % predicted in May .
It maintained its forecast for growth of 1.8 % in 2018 .
Ster@@ ling fell against the dollar and the euro following the news .
The pound was 0.5 % down at 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
The no-@@ change decision comes after recent disappointing growth figures have dam@@ pen@@ ed mounting expectations of a hike , with GDP ed@@ ging up to 0.3 % in the second quarter from 0.2 % in the previous three months .
Growth is likely to remain at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will start to pick up slightly at the end of the year , according to the Bank .
Its latest inflation report offered little che@@ er for households being hit by soaring inflation and pal@@ try pay rises as it said the squeeze will get worse before it gets better .
It added that monetary policy &quot; cannot prevent &quot; the hit to incomes over the next few years , but expects wages will recover &quot; significantly &quot; towards the end of its three-@@ year forecast .
The economy is also set for a boost from surging demand for British goods thanks to the weak pound , which will offset some of the lower consumer spending .
The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the shock EU referendum vote , which sent the pound slu@@ mping .
The Bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully feed through to prices and the economy .
Pri@@ or to the Bank &apos;s latest rates verdict , there had been growing clam@@ our for a rate rise as inflation ramp@@ ed up pressure on hard-@@ pressed households , with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5 % in July .
Inflation eased back to 2.6 % last month from 2.@@ 9 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and will pick up once again over the coming months .
The Bank said the over@@ sho@@ ot relative to its 2 % target was &quot; entirely &quot; down to the weak pound .
Andrew Mon@@ t@@ la@@ ke , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mor@@ tg@@ age Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; Given the recent fall in swap rates , the mortgage market looks set to become ever more competitive once more as lenders clam@@ our for business and look to end the year in positive fashion .
The market looks particularly good for those who may be coming to the end of their existing deals as re-@@ mortgages , many with fe@@ e-@@ free options as well as low rates , become ever more popular . &quot;

N@@ H@@ S to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug to 10,000
P@@ ati@@ ents will be able to access a &apos; transformative &apos; HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court battle over funding the drug on the N@@ H@@ S .
N@@ H@@ S England announced that pre-@@ exposure pro@@ phy@@ la@@ x@@ is ( Pr@@ E@@ P ) , a p@@ ill taken before sex which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-@@ risk individuals by around 86 per cent , will now be provided by the health service through an initial three-@@ year trial to an estimated 10,000 people .
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al up@@ held a High Court ruling last year , which said the N@@ H@@ S had the power to pay for Pr@@ E@@ P despite its claims that local authorities should fund it .
The move announced on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day was ha@@ iled as a &apos; major new intervention &apos; by N@@ H@@ S England chief executive Sim@@ on St@@ ev@@ ens while the National A@@ ids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described it as a &apos; pivo@@ tal moment &apos; .
S@@ ex@@ ual health clinics in London , B@@ righ@@ ton , Manch@@ ester , Li@@ ver@@ pool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to start enrol@@ ling people , with more clinics joining in October before full implementation across England by April 2018 .
Pre@@ -@@ exposure pro@@ phy@@ la@@ x@@ is ( Pr@@ E@@ P ) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of getting HIV .
Tri@@ als have shown Pr@@ E@@ P significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at-@@ risk of infection .
Taking Pr@@ E@@ P before sex means there is just enough of certain drugs in a person &apos;s body to prevent an HIV infection taking hold .
Such drugs can be taken every day or as soon as two hours before having sex .
Those eligible for the treatment include gay or bi@@ sexual men , trans@@ gender people and those with HIV@@ -@@ positive partners who are not successfully receiving treatment .
Clin@@ ics will identify eligible participants who consent to the trial , including men , women , trans@@ gender people , and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti-@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
People living and registered with a G@@ P in England will also be able to en@@ ro@@ l for potential participation at their local participating sexual health clin@@ ic .
The program@@ me will cost £ 10 million and N@@ H@@ S England signed a contract to source the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement .
The trial is designed to assess the full potential of Pr@@ E@@ P by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted , taken up , and implemented on a large scale .
M@@ r St@@ ev@@ ens said : &apos; This major new intervention should complement and super@@ charge the wide@@ -@@ ranging and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV .
It &apos;s another milestone in more than three decades &apos; worth of progress in tackling one of humanity &apos;s major health challenges . &apos; 
De@@ bor@@ ah G@@ old , chief executive at NA@@ T ( National A@@ ids Trust ) , said : &apos; This is a pivo@@ tal moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ E@@ P , if targeted properly at those in need and at risk , offers the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic .
From September , people at high risk of HIV will have access via this N@@ H@@ S@@ -@@ funded trial in England to an empowering new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
We war@@ mly welcome this announcement . &apos; 
I@@ an Green , chief executive of the Ter@@ rence Hig@@ g@@ ins Trust , said : &apos; The priority must now be to make sure that the trial is rolled out spe@@ e@@ dily across the country , and that no-@@ one at risk of HIV is left behind .
Now that the Pr@@ E@@ P trial drug has been procu@@ red , we &apos;@@ re well on the way to protecting over 10,000 people at risk of HIV . &apos; 
Sha@@ dow public health minister Sharon H@@ od@@ g@@ son said : &apos; The start of the Pr@@ E@@ P trial is welcome and long overdue after months of delays and he@@ el-@@ dra@@ gging by the Government .
The evidence shows just how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life-@@ changing infection .
This trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of Pr@@ E@@ P .
Now it is important that this trial is rolled out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are exposed to HIV and help take us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society . &apos;

Li@@ ving the high life : me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine floor and clever design tric@@ ks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court flat into a sp@@ acious home
Jo@@ ann@@ e Le@@ igh , a former banker with a passion for doing up property , down@@ sized from a large home in K@@ night@@ s@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court apar@@ tment in 2014 .
It is on the first floor of a smart Qu@@ e@@ en An@@ ne ter@@ race - and it is a te@@ st@@ ament to the new design that Jo@@ ann@@ e hasn &apos;t pac@@ ked her bag@@ s and sold on .
&quot; Before this , I was living with my ex in K@@ night@@ s@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; Jo@@ ann@@ e says .
&quot; I was looking for something that was comparable for my price .
I was shown this apar@@ tment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ce@@ il@@ ings .
I fell in love with it and put an offer in that day . &quot;
Since the first viewing , the 1,000@@ s@@ q ft flat has had a complete overhaul .
O@@ rig@@ in@@ ally a one-@@ bed@@ room property with a conv@@ olu@@ ted lay@@ out - you had to walk through the kit@@ ch@@ en to get to the bed@@ room - Jo@@ ann@@ e wanted to add storage space and a me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine to make the most of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ce@@ il@@ ings , big win@@ dow@@ s , lots of light .
That was my requirement , &quot; she says .
To this end , she employed Er@@ fan Az@@ adi of Not@@ ting H@@ ill@@ -based architecture and design stu@@ di@@ o D@@ uck &amp; Sh@@ ed to exploit the 12@@ .@@ 5@@ ft ce@@ il@@ ings and create a home that wasn &apos;t only a development but a place for Jo@@ ann@@ e to live .
The ceiling wasn &apos;t quite t@@ all enough to add two sp@@ aces on top of each other so the archit@@ ec@@ tural challenge was to create a me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine that you could stand up in .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to resolve the brief .
&quot; The ste@@ el@@ work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; We had to ar@@ range the sp@@ aces so that they stac@@ ked on top of each other without nee@@ ding to hun@@ ch down .
It wasn &apos;t just building a simple platform , but c@@ ranking the ste@@ els so that they were at the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
This arrangement allowed Er@@ fan to get two full-@@ height rooms on top of each other in the space - with lots of added drama .
For the me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine , a v@@ int@@ age copper light window from Re@@ trou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the g@@ lam@@ or@@ ous living area below .
Mir@@ ro@@ red gold fur@@ nit@@ ure , silver acc@@ ents and v@@ int@@ age Ser@@ ge M@@ ou@@ ille ligh@@ ting all set the style for the scheme .
The use of mir@@ rors plays a part in adding the@@ at@@ re , space and light .
A short cor@@ rid@@ or is mir@@ ro@@ red at both ends to make it appear longer .
In the kit@@ ch@@ en , the mir@@ ro@@ red spl@@ ash@@ back feels like a window to another room .
At the ent@@ rance , mir@@ ro@@ red units provide storage for all Jo@@ ann@@ e &apos;s cut@@ l@@ ery and gl@@ as@@ sw@@ are .
Gi@@ ving the perception of a more g@@ lam@@ or@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room is being able to close off the kit@@ ch@@ en when it &apos;s not in use .
Fol@@ d@@ away kit@@ ch@@ ens are nothing new .
What &apos;s unique about this one is that it &apos;s a gar@@ age-@@ style lif@@ t-@@ up door .
&quot; A bit of engineering went into that , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the ste@@ el-@@ reinforced , ven@@ e@@ ered MD@@ F door .
&quot; It &apos;s counter-@@ weighted so that when you push the door up , it gli@@ des really easily . &quot;
Thanks to clever use of space and storage , Jo@@ ann@@ e gained an additional 16@@ s@@ q m , an extra bed@@ room and an improved lay@@ out .
&quot; At the end of the day , floor space is what you are going to sell - or how your property is valued , &quot; Er@@ fan says .
&quot; In a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will walk in and do a calculation based on floor size . &quot;
Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using quality materials that give the space its lux@@ uri@@ ous edge .
&quot; The materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; You don &apos;t fall in love with the electri@@ cal fe@@ eds in the walls .
These are important but they don &apos;t pull the heart str@@ ings . &quot;
It goes to show that through good design and increased square me@@ tre@@ age , a flat can turn from something standard into something quite amaz@@ ing .
In fact , like Jo@@ ann@@ e , you may choose not to leave .

Brothers fight over $ 500 million property empire
Two brothers are at war over one of Vic@@ t@@ oria &apos;s biggest real estate empi@@ res , worth more than $ 500 million , four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty .
Former Car@@ l@@ ton Foot@@ ball Club director and develop@@ er C@@ oli@@ n D@@ e Lu@@ tis lives in a To@@ or@@ ak man@@ sion three doors from younger brother Paul , who has taken him to the Supreme Court over how their property and business assets will be s@@ lic@@ ed up .
Paul has wanted out of the family business since 2014 but an ac@@ ri@@ mon@@ ious argument is playing out in the Supreme Court over the break@@ -up .
Together with their mother Ann@@ a the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , am@@ as@@ sed since the family bought a Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood , shop in 1973 .
There , the family founded West@@ co Je@@ ans and grew it into a chain of 160 retail outlets .
It sold in 1999 for $ 85 million .
That money was sun@@ k into property and the D@@ e Lu@@ tis portfolio now includes city offices , B@@ run@@ sw@@ ick and Sor@@ ren@@ to development sites , G@@ old Co@@ ast and M@@ t Bul@@ ler apar@@ tments , and sub@@ urban shopping cent@@ res .
Under an agreement with their late father , C@@ oli@@ n - described by Paul as &quot; the major driving force and the dominant personality &quot; in the D@@ e Lu@@ tis family - ow@@ ns about two-thirds of the company assets and Paul about one-third .
A court fil@@ ing says this transl@@ ates to C@@ oli@@ n ow@@ ning property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul $ 17@@ 6 million .
Di@@ vi@@ ding the properties and cash has proved the stic@@ king point for Paul .
&quot; The sp@@ li@@ ts proposed by C@@ oli@@ n left him with what I considered to be the best properties , &quot; he wrote in an initial court aff@@ id@@ av@@ it in 2015 .
Last Fri@@ day , after several failed medi@@ ations , the first Supreme Court hearing was held .
The brothers are also now fighting over who controls the existing business - which Paul alleg@@ es C@@ oli@@ n has locked him out of .
C@@ oli@@ n argues this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul of in@@ compet@@ ently managing some properties .
In an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it fil@@ ed by C@@ oli@@ n , he says he hopes to resolve the dispute .
&quot; My Italian heritage dictates that family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
Co@@ sts are mounting in the case , with hundreds of pages of aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , em@@ ails and reports by companies including De@@ lo@@ it@@ te , P@@ it@@ cher Partn@@ ers and Charter K@@ ec@@ k C@@ ra@@ mer fil@@ ed and top barri@@ sters including Al@@ lan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and senior so@@ lic@@ itors retained by both sides .
M@@ s D@@ e Lu@@ tis and her late husband Lu@@ ig@@ i were Italian immigrants who ran mil@@ k bars and de@@ lic@@ at@@ ess@@ ens from the late 1950s and in the early 1970s bought a shop in B@@ run@@ sw@@ ick .
They used the collateral to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property where C@@ oli@@ n opened the family &apos;s first je@@ ans store .
C@@ oli@@ n says he started West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my final years of high school , when Paul was a young child ( around 10 years old ) . &quot;
Ann@@ a D@@ e Lu@@ tis says she and Lu@@ ig@@ i , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass down their properties to their sons am@@ ic@@ ably .
&quot; Lu@@ ig@@ i often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court , &quot; she wrote .
Two other brothers , Mark and Lu@@ ke , are no longer part of the D@@ e Lu@@ tis group of companies , with C@@ oli@@ n saying that Mark was paid $ 10 million when he left the business , and Lu@@ ke $ 26 million .
Both Lu@@ ke and Mark had become , Paul says , &quot; bitter about the terms of their financial separation . &quot;
C@@ oli@@ n has kept a low profile despite being a former A@@ F@@ L club board member and , according to a 2015 bio@@ graphy of Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the television star &apos;s best friend .
F@@ air@@ fa@@ x Me@@ dia cont@@ acted C@@ oli@@ n and Paul D@@ e Lu@@ tis on Fri@@ day , and their lawyers .
Only C@@ oli@@ n replied , by text message , to say that because the case was before the courts &quot; I really cannot say much . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s very , very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to sue me and drag our family name through the courts , &quot; he wrote .
In mid-@@ 2016 , C@@ oli@@ n wrote in one court fil@@ ing that he had tried to accommodate his brother &apos;s requests .
&quot; Our father would not have wanted to see Paul and I end up in our current dispute , &quot; he said , adding that he was &quot; still hopeful of resolution . &quot;
On Fri@@ day , that hope appeared gone .
&quot; Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; C@@ oli@@ n wrote .

The o@@ ath is just a mirror , on which we shall check ourselves frequently for rec@@ ti@@ fying our shortcomings , temper@@ ing our Party spirit and interpre@@ ting the belief in our heart through our concrete actions .

Xi Jinping stressed that to achieve the party &apos;s targets of strong military in the new era and to build a world-@@ class military , we must grasp the key to be able to fight and win the war .
The entire army must con@@ scienti@@ ously study and implement the spirit of the 19@@ th National Congress of the Communist Party , thoroughly study and implement the party &apos;s idea of
strengthening the armed forces in the new era , implement the military strategic principles in new situations , strengthen the responsibilities of missions , strengthen the reforms and innovations , strengthen the implementation of work , and compreh@@ en@@ sively improving the ability to prepare for the war in the new era , providing strategic support for achieving the two hun@@ dre@@ d-@@ year goals and
the Chinese dream to realize the great re@@ ju@@ ven@@ ation of the Chinese nation .
At 9 : 30 am , Xi Jinping in full military uni@@ forms went to the Central building of the Committee of Central Military Commission .
Xi Jinping has always attached great importance to the issue of war prepar@@ ations of our military .
On the second day after the conclusion of the 19@@ th Party Congress , Xi Jinping pre@@ sided over the first meeting of the Central Military Commission . He emphasized that the Military Commission should promote the work of the entire military .
Xi Jinping pointed out that the military must prepare for a war , and that the Central Military Commission must understand how to fight with good plan and comman@@ ding in the war .
C@@ M@@ C should set up the bat@@ on for fight in the war at the beginning of the work .
To come to the CT@@ C Central Committee today , it is to take a cle@@ ar-@@ cut attitude , starting from me and starting from the Central Military Commission , we must strengthen our work on war prepar@@ ations .
We must increase our ability to win , work hard to prepare for war , and lead our army to be able to fight and win the war , so as to bear the mission of the new era ent@@ ru@@ sted by the party and the people .

In April last year , Xi Jinping made a special trip to insp@@ ect this place .
Over the past year or so , the C@@ M@@ C Central Committee has made many new improvements . Xi Jinping was very ple@@ ased and encouraged everyone to continue to improve
his joint warfare command capability .
At 10 , Xi Jinping took a seat at the general command post ,
called front task force through the video .
This year &apos;s temperature dropped to min@@ us 12 degrees Celsius , yet it was not very cold .
At present , it is able to meet the needs for the winter and for performing various tasks .
How is the daily combat training ?
How is the related security work going on ?
What are the practical difficulties ?
Xi Jinping asked many details .
How do you feel about such routine tra@@ in@@ ings for combat teams ?
I ’ d like to report to the Com@@ man@@ der that we will always be ready for war , and the air@@ cra@@ f@@ t-@@ warning ra@@ dar and sea-@@ warning ra@@ dar will be available on a 7 * 24 basis in order to keep a close eye on the sky and sea and allow us to formulate improved response solutions .
Tra@@ in@@ ings and dri@@ l@@ ls in various aspects such as fighting back and pat@@ ro@@ l inspec@@ tion were organized on a regular basis .
Xi Jinping urged them to exercise vigil@@ ance and be ready for responding to any emergency .
Next , Xi Jinping checked the D@@ ji@@ b@@ ou@@ ti@@ -based Security B@@ ase via video .
This base is the first overseas security base of the Chinese Nav@@ y .
A four-@@ level ( including red level , or@@ ange level , yel@@ low level and green level ) al@@ er@@ ting and defense system was built and eight emergency response teams are always ready . Military dri@@ l@@ ls were organized on an ir@@ regular basis in order to realize … …
Then , Xi Jinping list@@ ened to a work report about t@@ roo@@ p training and war preparation of the whole army and delivered a ke@@ y@@ note speech .
Xi Jinping recognized and appreciated the great result of t@@ roo@@ p training and war preparation achieved by the whole army since the 18@@ th National Congress of the Communist Party of China .
He stressed that China is developing into a powerful country from a big country in this key stage . China has a promising future on one hand and is also facing severe challenges on the other hand .
It is impossible to achieve the great re@@ ju@@ ven@@ ation of the Chinese nation simply by doing some easy works and having celebr@@ ations .
Military struggle is an important aspect in fighting great battles , and the ability to win battles serves as a strategic ability required for safeguarding national security .
The whole military should strength awareness of hardship , awareness of crisis and awareness of war fighting , concentrate on fighting war and make every effort to prepare for war .
Im@@ prove the ability in war preparation and war fighting as soon as possible
Efforts should be made to fight innovative war and make preparation for war , keep up with evolution in war situation and method of war fighting ,
align with war tasks and opponents and ar@@ ouse a trend of research@@ ing on war-@@ related issues
Efforts should be made to improve construction of the comman@@ ding system and ability in joint operation , em@@ anci@@ p@@ ate mind , make innovations in practice and work harder , build a strong and high-@@ efficiency ...
Efforts should be made to deepen actual war@@ -based military training and insist on the principle that military training should be performed completely based on requirements of actual war .
En@@ thusi@@ as@@ m , initiative and creativity of officers and soldiers should be given full play ,
and an up@@ surge of military training should be ar@@ oused in the whole army
Xi Jinping stressed that leading cad@@ res at all levels , especially high-@@ ranking cad@@ res , should play a leading role in war preparation and war fighting .
It is necessary to establish proper outlook on career , outlook on power and outlook on position and strengthen their awareness in war preparation and war fighting .

The report delivered by General Secretary Xi in the 19@@ th CP@@ C National Congress has truly struck a ch@@ or@@ d in the hearts of our people .
I have list@@ ened carefully to the report and noticed that our people have been mentioned 20@@ 3 times , and cultural development 72 times by General Secretary Xi .

cultural confidence is of great significance not only to the cultural confidence of our cultural workers but also to the entire Chinese people .
The report of the 19@@ th CP@@ C National Congress points out ,
we must promote the creative evolution and development of fine traditional Chinese culture , see our revolutionary culture remains alive and strong , and develop an advanced socialist culture . We should cher@@ ish our cultural roots , draw on other cultures , and be for@@ ward-@@ thinking .
We should do more to foster a Chinese spirit , Chinese values , and Chinese strength in order to provide a source of cultural and moral guidance for our people .

So in the following five years , we should continue to create works that belong to our nation and which reflect the human@@ istic spirit of the socialism for a new era .
Therefore , we should display the era adequately in our works .

Trump &apos;s new chief of staff plans to restrict the president &apos;s media diet .
Others have tried and failed .
Maybe John F. Kel@@ ly can actually do it .
If so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tic@@ o reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the bo@@ ss on a more even ke@@ el .
Here &apos;s a bit from repor@@ ter Jo@@ sh D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; When new White House Chief of Sta@@ ff John F. Kel@@ ly hu@@ ddled with senior staff on his first day at work , he out@@ lined a key problem in President Donald Trump &apos;s White House that he planned to fix : bad information getting into the president &apos;s hands .
Kel@@ ly told the staff that information needed to flow through him - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if given good information . &quot;
Kel@@ ly &apos;s diagnosis makes perfect sense , but others have tried and failed to t@@ ame Trump by monitoring his media diet .
President Trump &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he &apos;s in the White House , his T@@ V@@ -@@ watching habit is still going strong .
&quot; If candidate Trump was up@@ set about unfair coverage , it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from outlets that were persu@@ ad@@ able , &quot; S@@ am N@@ un@@ berg , a former campaign adviser , told Poli@@ tic@@ o in February .
Poli@@ tic@@ o &apos;s T@@ ara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keeping Trump &apos;s Twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise . &quot;
O@@ k@@ ay .
But the idea that Trump &apos;s Twitter habit has ever been &quot; under control &quot; is la@@ ug@@ hable .
Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don &apos;t - that Trump &apos;s twe@@ ets would have been even more inflam@@ mat@@ ory if not for their interventions .
We &apos;@@ ll probably never know about twe@@ ets that Trump didn &apos;t send .
If his staff@@ ers managed to him out of trouble even a few times , then their efforts were worthwhile .
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from stir@@ ring up controversy .
Part of the problem is that in a White House composed of competing factions , people invariably try to advance their agendas by pres@@ enting Trump with material - which may or may not be reliable - that promotes their world@@ views .
Poli@@ tic@@ o - all over this story - reported in May on advisers &apos; pen@@ chan@@ ts for strategically feeding dubious information to the president .
This was one example , described by repor@@ ter S@@ han@@ e Gold@@ mach@@ er :
&quot; Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react vol@@ can@@ ically to negative press cli@@ ps , especially those with damaging lea@@ ks , becoming eng@@ ro@@ ssed in finding out where they originated .
That is what happened in late February when someone mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ously gave the president a printed cop@@ y of an article from G@@ ot@@ New@@ s@@ .@@ com , the web@@ site of Internet provoc@@ ate@@ ur Charles C. Johnson , which accused deputy chief of staff K@@ ati@@ e Wal@@ sh of being &apos; the source behind a bun@@ ch of lea@@ ks &apos; in the White House .
No matter that Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter for har@@ ass@@ ment or that he offered no concrete evidence or that he had lob@@ bed false accusations in the past and rec@@ an@@ ted them .
Trump read the article and began asking staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ mach@@ er added that then-@@ chief of staff Re@@ ince Pri@@ e@@ bus and White House staff secretary Ro@@ b Por@@ ter &quot; have tried to implement a system to manage and document the pap@@ er@@ work Trump receives . &quot;
How &apos;@@ d that work out ?
Kel@@ ly is trying to do the same thing , three months later .
Perhaps he will prove a more effective manag@@ er than Pri@@ e@@ bus , but Trump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his a@@ ides are still v@@ ying for influence .
Those im@@ mu@@ table factors will make Kel@@ ly &apos;s mission very difficult .

Wal@@ king through the An@@ chan@@ g An@@ ci@@ ent T@@ own in Sha@@ ox@@ ing , you can see ho@@ o@@ p buc@@ kets , b@@ am@@ bo@@ o k@@ n@@ itting , iron@@ making , sho@@ es sti@@ t@@ ching , l@@ ace making , co@@ tton sp@@ inning and other traditional han@@ dic@@ raft techniques almost everywhere , which fully represent the int@@ an@@ gible cultural heritage of the An@@ chan@@ g An@@ ci@@ ent T@@ own . T@@ ou@@ rists all over the world are en@@ chan@@ ted to experience the fol@@ k customs and feel the atmosphere of Sha@@ ox@@ ing &apos;s historical and cultural experience .
It is reported that during the three-@@ day New Year &apos;s holiday , more than 65@@ ,000 tourists visit An@@ chan@@ g An@@ ci@@ ent T@@ own .
In Z@@ he@@ jiang , a town with a unique style such as An@@ chan@@ g An@@ ci@@ ent T@@ own is sc@@ attered all over like stars . The g@@ lit@@ tering waves of Ji@@ ax@@ ing X@@ it@@ ang is flowing with the war@@ m@@ th and gr@@ ate@@ fulness of the lower reaches of the Y@@ ang@@ ze River in the south ; the white walls of Qu@@ zhou &apos;s Ni@@ an@@ bad@@ u An@@ ci@@ ent T@@ own con@@ vey to us the changes over time in the town ; and the mur@@ als of fish@@ er@@ men in Sh@@ it@@ ang , Ta@@ iz@@ hou draw a picture of their life , both traditional and modern . These towns are the &quot; pal@@ m treas@@ ure &quot; of Z@@ he@@ jiang tourism and also the favor@@ ites of tourists from all regions .
In recent years , with the promotion of tourism construction throughout the whole region , the potential of Z@@ he@@ jiang ’ s small towns have been gradually awak@@ ened .
In 2016 , the provincial government office issued the &quot; The implementation of the creation of a tou@@ rist town in Z@@ he@@ jiang Prov@@ ince ” , which proposed that the province would accept and name about 100 tou@@ rist towns with strong fol@@ k customs , beautiful ecological environment and rich tourism industries after 5 years or so .
Today , these little towns have become key dest@@ inations for visit@@ ors to Z@@ he@@ jiang who come to ad@@ mire the natural sc@@ ener@@ y , sav@@ or Z@@ he@@ jiang culture , and feel nostal@@ gic about Z@@ he@@ jiang . They will also become key drivers to help the Prov@@ ince create “ Pic@@ tu@@ res@@ que Z@@ he@@ jiang ” , China ’ s most beautiful tou@@ rist destination .
The responsible people of the Prov@@ in@@ cial T@@ ou@@ rism Bu@@ reau established that with the rise of these tourism style towns , we must now pay more attention to the construction of the person@@ alized tourism industry and new tourism projects and form@@ ats emerging one after another . These have brought rich experiences to tourists and earned g@@ lowing repu@@ tations .
Emp@@ ha@@ sis on promotion
Recently , directed by the Z@@ he@@ jiang Prov@@ in@@ cial T@@ ou@@ rism Bu@@ reau and Z@@ he@@ jiang D@@ aily P@@ ress Group , the T@@ ou@@ rism F@@ ull Me@@ dia Center of the Z@@ he@@ jiang D@@ aily P@@ ress Group hosted the “ T@@ ow@@ ns × Future artists &quot; sharing session and the 2017 promotion season of Z@@ he@@ jiang style tourism towns , &quot; Po@@ e@@ tic Z@@ he@@ jiang , T@@ ow@@ ns with fol@@ k customs ” . The closing ceremon@@ y took place in the Z@@ he@@ jiang exhi@@ bi@@ tion h@@ all .
“ A style town has arti@@ stic beauty and living war@@ m@@ th .
The style of the towns lies in the original sense , fla@@ v@@ or and tow@@ n@@ ship , which represents the original p@@ urity .
X@@ ie Han@@ f@@ en@@ g , a teacher at the School of F@@ il@@ m and Te@@ le@@ vision An@@ im@@ ation Ar@@ ts of China ’ s Academy of Ar@@ t , the domestic A@@ -@@ list film and television advertising director , and Pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or X@@ u X@@ i@@ an@@ gh@@ ong , the de@@ an of the School of Ar@@ t and Commun@@ ic@@ ation at China J@@ ili@@ ang University , talked about the cross-border stories of towns through T@@ ow@@ ns in the l@@ ens and Recon@@ struction of small village .
Many scen@@ ic tou@@ rist towns in Z@@ he@@ jiang have deep cultural resources . D@@ ong X@@ inj@@ ian , a town deputy from N@@ anx@@ un , Hu@@ zhou , appeared in the site in person and interpreted N@@ anx@@ un as a traditional Chinese pain@@ ting .
The style of towns in the south of the lower reaches of the Y@@ ang@@ ze River have been popular with pa@@ inter@@ s since ancient times . Nowadays , the N@@ anx@@ un An@@ ci@@ ent T@@ own is developing in-@@ depth cooperation with art academ@@ ies such as the China Academy of Ar@@ t .
T@@ ou@@ rism style towns must be equipped with elements of style , tourism , service and the environment .
Among these , tourism service facilities and the environment are very important .
If the tourists are handed in an umb@@ rel@@ la on a ra@@ iny day , they can better experience the town ’ s style .
In the era of sharing , the T@@ ou@@ rism F@@ ull Me@@ dia Center of the Z@@ he@@ jiang D@@ aily P@@ ress Group te@@ amed up with the hot@@ test shared umb@@ rel@@ la company to custom@@ ize a number of shared umb@@ rel@@ las in “ Po@@ e@@ tic Z@@ he@@ jiang ” style , hoping to promote the concept of “ Shar@@ ing and Green ” , spread the awareness of civilized tourism and public morality among tourists and residents , and create a shared , beautiful tou@@ rist environment .
This has become a bright spot in the 2017 promo@@ tional season of Z@@ he@@ jiang ’ s tourism towns , &quot; Po@@ e@@ tic Z@@ he@@ jiang , T@@ ow@@ ns with fol@@ k customs ” .
Ex@@ p@@ ecting won@@ ders
Up to now , Z@@ he@@ jiang Prov@@ ince has released the list of the first 21 provin@@ ci@@ al-@@ level tourism towns that will ultimately culmin@@ ate in a grand total of 11@@ 5 provincial tourism towns .
As the prior area for the development of rural tourism during the “ 13@@ th Five-Year Plan ” period , the style towns will eventually be built into tou@@ rist attrac@@ tions with a grade of 3@@ A or higher , becoming a new model for tourism product diversity , tourism benefits and industrial integration .
What makes tourism style towns attractive is their auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity and origin@@ ality .
The beauty of the tourism style towns not only stems from the mist@@ y bridges and rivers , but also from a long history of cultural tradition ; the revit@@ alization of the country is due to cultural self-@@ confidence .
Throughout the world , the tu@@ li@@ ps of the Netherlands ’ Lis@@ se T@@ own , the sal@@ t of Austria ’ s H@@ all@@ stat@@ t T@@ own , and the pu@@ mp@@ kins of P@@ um@@ p@@ kin T@@ own in France , have been attracting a large number of tourists from all over the world each year . This has allowed the realization that tourism could help the economic growth of small@@ s towns as well .
For the style towns , the point “ Emp@@ ha@@ sis on characteristics and re@@ tention of nostalgia ” has given the towns a distinct personality and soul , further providing cultural per@@ me@@ ation , carrying local cultural traditions , and highlighting native civilizations .
T@@ ou@@ rism style towns , with culture and nostalgia as the link and human@@ ities and sc@@ ener@@ y as the car@@ rier , connect tourists all over the world while inher@@ it and innovate the traditional customs and cultures in the co-@@ construction and sharing process .
E@@ ss@@ entially speaking , the tourism style town is a complex open-@@ style tourism area , and it should be a shared living space for local residents , ex@@ otic tourists and even so@@ journ@@ ers .
As the main battlefield for tourism growth in the future , tourism style towns will change the rural ecological landscape , economic and social development patterns , and the flow direction of industrial factors . Ad@@ di@@ tionally , they will play an important role in eliminating the urban@@ -@@ rural infrastructure gap , ha@@ st@@ ening rural cultural recovery .
In the wake of accelerating revit@@ alization of the countryside , Z@@ he@@ jiang tou@@ rist towns will receive a more abundant and won@@ der@@ ful story .
F@@ ig@@ ures indicate that 70 % of China ’ s travel demand is concentrated within a 3@@ k@@ m radi@@ us . On this basis , the short-@@ distance travel market will become a bi@@ ke sharing par@@ adi@@ se sooner or later .

Tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ers negotiate tren@@ ch , return to &apos; M@@ illion@@ aire &apos;s row@@ &apos;
Some of the West M@@ id@@ lands &apos; wealthiest homeowners are again at log@@ ger@@ heads with determined trav@@ ell@@ ers who have negotiated a coun@@ c@@ il-@@ du@@ g tren@@ ch to rec@@ laim a field outside their man@@ sions .
The trav@@ ell@@ ers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans in a field outside a prosperous street of Soli@@ h@@ ull dubbed &apos; m@@ illion@@ aire &apos;s row &apos; .
Br@@ inging hor@@ ses , babies and an army of v@@ ans , they have returned after being k@@ icked out only in May , un@@ deter@@ red by a mo@@ at du@@ g by the council to prevent their incur@@ sions .
The tac@@ tful group found a gap in the def@@ ences , squee@@ zing their vehicles though a section left un@@ bar@@ ric@@ aded to accommodate a path@@ way .
F@@ uri@@ ous residents have sav@@ aged Soli@@ h@@ ull Council saying it was &apos; useless at dealing with the problem &apos; .
One an@@ onymous re@@ sident said : &apos; They moved there on Mon@@ day night after being moved on from B@@ ent@@ ley He@@ ath where they were throwing roc@@ ks at pass@@ ers by .
The council needs to be sha@@ med into action as they are useless at dealing with the problem .
The trav@@ ell@@ ers were there in May , were moved on and now they are back again .
More arrived last night , probably even more today . &apos; 
She added : &apos; B@@ ir@@ m@@ ing@@ ham council knows how to deal with this by getting long inj@@ unc@@ tions to protect their par@@ ks .
I live on Stre@@ et@@ s@@ bro@@ ok road and I &apos;@@ m not happy to continue paying my council tax when the council can &apos;t even stop this . &apos; 
One local re@@ sident who did not wish to be named said : &apos; It is ridic@@ ul@@ ous , we have only just seen the last round of these trav@@ ell@@ ers leaving , only to be bli@@ gh@@ ted by another round .
The numbers have increased this time and a horse has even been seen gra@@ zing on the par@@ k@@ land . &apos; 
A spokes@@ woman for Soli@@ h@@ ull Council said : &apos; We are aware of an un@@ author@@ ised en@@ camp@@ ment on land off Stre@@ et@@ s@@ bro@@ ok Road and working alongside Soli@@ h@@ ull Poli@@ ce , we are undertaking the necessary legal actions to move them on as quickly as possible .
To support our evidence gathering it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-@@ social or criminal behavi@@ our to the police by calling 10@@ 1 .
This helps build a picture of the situation for the court to consider when we present our case to them . &apos;

M@@ a Jun@@ sh@@ en@@ g said that efforts to resolve four major prominent issues in the express delivery industry will be enhanced this year . The development of the express delivery industry in China has entered the express lan@@ e .
In 2012 , express delivery volume in China stood at 5.@@ 6 billion items , and at least 10,000 express delivery three-@@ whe@@ el@@ ers were deployed . A single standard , a unique lo@@ go and a unified insurance were implemented , which facilitated delivery and ensured safety .

Italy tough@@ ens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean they will not be allowed to continue if they do not sign up to new rules governing their operations .
&quot; If NGOs do not sign up to a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue operating , &quot; Inter@@ ior Minister Mar@@ co Min@@ n@@ iti said in an interview with Tur@@ in daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ n@@ iti &apos;s warning came a day after Italian authorities imp@@ ounded a boat operated by German aid organ@@ is@@ ati@@ ion J@@ ug@@ end Re@@ t@@ te@@ t on suspicion its cre@@ w effectively collabor@@ ated with people traffic@@ kers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .
The aid organ@@ is@@ ation , which has only been operational for a year , declined to comment on the substance of detailed allegations made against it by Italian prosecutor Am@@ bro@@ gi@@ o Car@@ to@@ si@@ o .
&quot; For us the rescue of human life is and will be our top priority , so we are very sor@@ ry we will not be able to operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; the organ@@ is@@ ation said in a statement on social media .
&quot; We can only assess all the accusations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation . &quot;
Italian authorities had been monitoring J@@ ug@@ end Re@@ t@@ te@@ t &apos;s boat , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
Its cre@@ w is suspected to taking on board din@@ gh@@ y lo@@ ads of migrants delivered directly to them by people traffic@@ kers and allowing the smugg@@ lers to make off with the vessels to be used again .
At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosecutor &apos;s f@@ ile , the cont@@ ents of which were published by Italian media .
The cre@@ w are suspected of having flou@@ ted the authority of the Italian coast@@ guard , which over@@ sees rescue operations in the zone , out of humanitarian ze@@ al rather than for any other motives .
Under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a would notably have to have an Italian police officer on board monitoring their activities .
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to ab@@ ide by the code : S@@ ave The Children , Mal@@ ta@@ -based MO@@ AS and Spain &apos;s Pro@@ -@@ Ac@@ tiv@@ a Open Ar@@ ms .
The latter said on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day it regarded the new rules as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve any &quot; significant change or impedi@@ ment &quot; to its rescue operations .
Among those who have refused to sign is the Nobel Pri@@ z@@ e-@@ winning organ@@ is@@ ation Doc@@ tors Without B@@ orders ( M@@ S@@ F ) .
Min@@ n@@ iti meanwhile said a sharp fall over recent weeks in the number of migrants arri@@ ving in Italy following rescu@@ es was an indication that efforts to beef up the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors was bearing fruit .
&quot; In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tun@@ nel , &quot; the minister said .
He revealed plans for further talks this month with Libyan may@@ ors on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe .
Li@@ an P@@ ing , Chief Economist of the Bank of Commun@@ ic@@ ations , said that as value added of industry for each of the first three quarters of 2017 was stronger toward the end of the quarter , the growth rate of value added of industry in December could accelerate to 6.@@ 6 % .
C@@ umul@@ ative growth rate of fixed asset investment in December is forecast to be at 7.@@ 2 % , unchanged from the previous month , but lower than that a year ago .
Industrial production , while weaker than that in October , will remain generally unchanged from that in November .
Investment in China ’ s manufacturing sector was low in December , but infrastructure investment improved slightly . As such , fixed asset investment for the month will remain the same as that in November .
Most of the more than 200,000 people from Chang@@ le , Fu@@ j@@ ian Prov@@ ince entered the US as illegal immigrants . Li@@ ving in an ali@@ en country indefinitely , their families are separated and torn apart ; similar scenes such these have continued to un@@ fold .
Beijing ’ s new measure to “ shift and re@@ locate institutions of higher learning ” : 10,000 B@@ U@@ C@@ T teachers and students move into new cam@@ pus at Chang@@ ping
The opening ceremon@@ y of Beijing University of Ch@@ em@@ ical Technology ’ s ( B@@ U@@ C@@ T ) new cam@@ pus was held at the Chang@@ ping Dist@@ ric@@ t of Beijing on the 2@@ n@@ d , and school officially comm@@ enced at the 1,@@ 800 m@@ u green cam@@ pus .
Re@@ porters learned from the ceremon@@ y that for the purposes of enhancing the capital ’ s core functions , and treating “ large urban center diseases ” , on the back of cooperative development among Beijing , Ti@@ anj@@ in and He@@ be@@ i Prov@@ ince as well as the shifting and re@@ location of non-@@ capital related functions , Beijing has accelerated the program to shift and re@@ locate institutions of higher learning situ@@ ated in central districts to sub@@ urban districts in recent years . The teachers and students of some institutions of higher learning are re@@ loc@@ ating in bat@@ ches to new camp@@ uses in Sh@@ uny@@ i , D@@ ax@@ ing , F@@ ang@@ sh@@ ang and other sub@@ urban districts .
B@@ U@@ C@@ T ’ s new cam@@ pus is located in N@@ an@@ k@@ ou T@@ own , Chang@@ ping , and s@@ its on a land area of 1,@@ 800 m@@ u , some 40 k@@ m from the city . It is a key project of Beijing ’ s shifting and re@@ location of non-@@ capital functions .
The new cam@@ pus was constructed in three pha@@ ses . P@@ ha@@ se I is now entirely completely , and P@@ ha@@ se II is expected to comm@@ ence by the end of the year . On completion , the learning and living requirements of close to 20,000 under@@ graduate and graduate students as well as fac@@ ul@@ ty staff are expected to be met .
At this time , a review of this year ’ s film market will show that fans of the original book of a film adaptation and those of the actors taking part in film have become key components of the expected audience of the film .
At 17 : 10 today , the 11@@ 9 command center at Sha@@ o@@ yang received an emergency call . Te@@ tra@@ hydro@@ fur@@ an stored at H@@ ong@@ z@@ hi Ch@@ em@@ ical Pl@@ ant at L@@ ong@@ x@@ ut@@ ang , S@@ hu@@ ang@@ x@@ i Dist@@ ric@@ t , caught fire .
Sha@@ o@@ yang fire station immediately disp@@ at@@ ched five de@@ t@@ ach@@ ments and 20 fire tr@@ uc@@ ks with heavy chemical protective clothing , chemical clean@@ ing vehicles and other equipment to the scene .
Pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary investigation revealed that the cause of the fire was the small tanks in which te@@ tra@@ hydro@@ fur@@ an was stored . There was th@@ ick smo@@ ke at the scene .
At the time of fil@@ ing this report , fi@@ ref@@ igh@@ ters were in the processing of carrying out emergency rescue . The City ’ s health , safety administration , environmental protection , public security , traffic and other departments arrived at the scene suc@@ ces@@ sively . No fat@@ alities or injured persons were found .
Michel@@ le Carter sent@@ enced for tex@@ ts urging suicide of Con@@ ra@@ d Ro@@ y
A Massachusetts woman has been sent@@ enced to two and a half years for encouraging her boy@@ friend to commit suicide through tex@@ ts and phone calls .
Michel@@ le Carter , now 20 , will serve 15 months of her term behind bars and five years of prob@@ ation .
Carter was convicted in June of the invol@@ un@@ tary man@@ slaughter of Con@@ ra@@ d Ro@@ y , who took his own life on 13 July 2014 .
M@@ r Ro@@ y &apos;s father told Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day &apos;s hearing : &quot; My family is heart@@ broken .
My son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free pending an appeal .
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal team argued that both she and M@@ r Ro@@ y suffered from mental illness .
D@@ ressed in red tr@@ ous@@ ers and a cre@@ am bl@@ ouse , Carter stood te@@ ar@@ fully with hands clas@@ ped and eyes cast down as she was sent@@ enced .
&quot; Her actions killed Con@@ ra@@ d Ro@@ y , &quot; the prosecutor told the court .
&quot; She ended his life to better her own .
She has not accepted responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; She has shown no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
But Carter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; horri@@ ble circum@@ stance that she completely regre@@ ts . &quot;
However , Jud@@ ge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find that her &quot; age or level of maturity or even her mental illness have any significant impact on her actions . &quot;
A prosecutor read a statement from M@@ r Ro@@ y &apos;s mother , L@@ yn@@ n Ro@@ y , saying there was &quot; not one day I do not m@@ our@@ n the loss of my be@@ loved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I am handling everything - I am trying to be there for his sist@@ ers in all of my pain we will carry with us for e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity , &quot; it said .
M@@ r Ro@@ y &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Ro@@ y , tes@@ tified that she was &quot; ha@@ unted &quot; by the reali@@ s@@ ation that she would never attend her brother &apos;s we@@ d@@ ding or be an a@@ unt to his children .
&quot; Not having that one person I &apos;@@ ve been with every day since birth is a pain I &apos;@@ ll always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said .
The case appears to set a legal precedent , as there is no Massachusetts law that crimin@@ ali@@ ses telling a person to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 when M@@ r Ro@@ y was found dead of carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
The case drew national attention after Carter &apos;s text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; H@@ ang yourself , jump off a building , sta@@ b yourself I don &apos;t know there &apos;s a lot of ways , &quot; she said in several messages sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family .
In the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; You need to do it , Con@@ ra@@ d &quot; and &quot; All you have to do is turn the gener@@ ator on and you will be free and happy . &quot;
Jud@@ ge Mon@@ iz said Carter sought attention through M@@ r Ro@@ y &apos;s death , or@@ dering that she not be allowed to profit from the case through any press .
The case has divided legal opinion .
Among the few to defend Carter was A@@ man@@ da K@@ no@@ x , who was convicted of mur@@ dering her British ro@@ om@@ m@@ ate in Italy in 2007 before she was cle@@ ared two years ago .
M@@ s K@@ no@@ x , 30 , published an op@@ -@@ ed in the L@@ os Angel@@ es Times saying : &quot; Michel@@ le Carter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot;
Z@@ hang Y@@ im@@ ou is dest@@ ined to controversial film arti@@ st . From when he began fil@@ ming his first movie , “ Red Sor@@ gh@@ um ” , he has always been a tren@@ d@@ set@@ ter in Chinese films , but he has also received a lot of criticism .
On the 2@@ n@@ d , reporters learned from L@@ ha@@ sa P@@ ure Land Bas@@ ke@@ t@@ ball Club that the L@@ ha@@ sa P@@ ure Land Bas@@ ke@@ t@@ ball Y@@ outh Te@@ am came in fourth at the National Y@@ outh Bas@@ ke@@ t@@ ball League Fin@@ als held in Beijing .

Tibet ’ s “ Bas@@ ke@@ t@@ ball Ki@@ ds ” on their way to Beijing for the Fin@@ als .
P@@ ho@@ to : L@@ ha@@ sa P@@ ure Land Bas@@ ke@@ t@@ ball Club . L@@ ha@@ sa P@@ ure Land Bas@@ ke@@ t@@ ball Club ’ s General Man@@ ager Li@@ ang Jun@@ cha@@ o told reporters that compared to the previous year , the Te@@ am ’ s performance has improved . The players ’ self-@@ confidence and grasp of the game have increased significantly . Their exchanges with other teams were also more comprehensive , and exchanges both on and off the court have also increased and were more rela@@ xed .
After the competition ended , cap@@ tain Ji@@ ang Cu@@ o said that he hoped to gain experience from taking part in the competition , and do his best for Tibetan bas@@ ke@@ t@@ ball .
It is understood that during the competition , the players had to overcome factors such as low al@@ titude si@@ ck@@ ness , disp@@ laying the image of Tibet .
The fact that track and field involves the most gold me@@ d@@ als in the Olympics makes those athletes confident a lot , the famous players have been disadvantaged in the competition .
Au@@ di to Mo@@ di@@ fy Up to 8@@ 50,000 D@@ ie@@ sel Ve@@ h@@ ic@@ les as Car@@ makers F@@ ace B@@ ack@@ lash
A day before Au@@ di &apos;s announcement , BM@@ W said it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350@@ ,000 vehicles .
The BM@@ W chairman said the company believed &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; ref@@ erring to the European cities - including Munich , where BM@@ W is based - that have considered ban@@ ning or restricting di@@ e@@ sel vehicles .
D@@ aim@@ ler announced on Tu@@ es@@ day that it would modi@@ fy three million Mer@@ ce@@ des vehicles in Europe to reduce their di@@ e@@ sel emissions .
None of the companies described the moves as rec@@ alls .
European car@@ makers have heavily promoted the use of di@@ e@@ sel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet rules on carbon dioxide emissions .
But the nit@@ ro@@ gen ox@@ ides that di@@ e@@ sel engines em@@ it are considered car@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ s , and can cause as@@ th@@ ma .
The cost to autom@@ o@@ tive companies of inst@@ alling equipment to neutrali@@ ze the fu@@ mes emit@@ ted by di@@ e@@ sel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive .
As German autom@@ akers face scrutiny , the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of co@@ ddling the powerful car companies and of ignoring signs of the problem .
The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Vol@@ k@@ sw@@ ag@@ en , which covered up its use of so-called defeat devices that could adjust emissions to comply with regulations when a car was being tested , but ease back in normal driving conditions .
Several Vol@@ k@@ sw@@ ag@@ en executives have been charged in the United States , and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic .
Last month , the former head of ther@@ mo@@ dynamics at Au@@ di &apos;s engine development department was arrested in Germany .
The former manag@@ er , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Gi@@ ov@@ ann@@ i P@@ am@@ i@@ o , is Italian , and therefore is not protected from extra@@ dition and could face trial in the United States .
Early this year , Au@@ di was swept up into a German criminal investigation involving Vol@@ k@@ sw@@ ag@@ en after the authorities accused Au@@ di of inst@@ alling a system to ev@@ ade emissions rules in Europe , broadening an inquiry that had focused on the United States .
The inclusion of Au@@ di in the investigation could weigh heavily on Vol@@ k@@ sw@@ ag@@ en : The luxury car@@ maker accounts for a disproportionate share of Vol@@ k@@ sw@@ ag@@ en &apos;s profit .
Taking a couple of years , or even a few years , to make a film from planning to release is nothing unusual .
“ Big F@@ ish &amp; Beg@@ onia ” , an anim@@ ated feature film 12 years in the making , recently announced that it would be released on July 8@@ th .
Li@@ ang X@@ uan , the author of “ Big F@@ ish &amp; Beg@@ onia ” , dropped out of his studies at the Department of Th@@ er@@ mal Eng@@ ine@@ ering at T@@ sin@@ gh@@ ua University when he was 21 , and founded B &amp; T together with best friend Z@@ hang Ch@@ un . In 2008 , C@@ e Y@@ uan V@@ ent@@ ures provided US $ 1 million in risk investment , kick@@ -@@ starting the ma@@ iden anim@@ ated film , “ Big F@@ ish &amp; Beg@@ onia ” .
The film was already a recipient of multiple local and overseas a@@ wards at the creative sample stage . It has been included in the Cent@@ re P@@ om@@ pi@@ do@@ u ’ s collection and acc@@ la@@ im@@ ed as “ an outstanding ar@@ t@@ work ” .
As it took six years from creation to production , the film was known as a “ sup@@ er dec@@ ei@@ ver ” by millions of fans who were looking forward to its release .
“ Big F@@ ish &amp; Beg@@ onia ” is a Chinese fantasy . The announcement of the tra@@ il@@ ers for the scheduled release has once again led to new expectations among all view@@ ers .
Li@@ ang X@@ uan said , “ I ’ ve only done this one thing in the last 12 years . Now it has turned from a dream into reality . I ’ m both nervous and exc@@ ited ” .
Z@@ hang Ch@@ un said , “ I kept thinking of using one-@@ fif@@ ti@@ eth of other people ’ s budget to come up with an image effect that was completely identical to these other people ’ s . I drove our entire team up the wall . ”
D@@ ong@@ gu@@ an , the “ Fac@@ tory of the World ” which once made its fortune on industrial processing and large numbers of general workers , is looking to high-level talent to help the city re@@ position itself .
The D@@ ong@@ gu@@ an government recently held a high-level talent week event . Re@@ porters from China Business Net@@ work noticed a number of repu@@ table local enterprises participating in the talent fair .
On the bright advertising board against a tang@@ er@@ ine colo@@ red wall , they listed their respective ex@@ or@@ bit@@ ant price tag@@ s .
Therefore , China Te@@ le@@ vision Dra@@ ma Pro@@ duction Indu@@ stry Association will work together with the television drama production industry nationwide to sign a self-@@ discipline convention .
Prov@@ ence la@@ ven@@ der under threat from climate change
It has become a symbol of Prov@@ ence in southern France , but there is a warning that it &apos;s under threat from climate change .
La@@ ven@@ der is in decline because of drough@@ t-@@ like conditions and dise@@ ase@@ -@@ carrying insec@@ ts , causing a major head@@ ac@@ he for scientists and farmers attempting to find solutions .
E@@ ric Cha@@ is@@ se , an expert at the Pro@@ ven@@ ce-@@ based agricultural research institu@@ te C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M , said : &quot; La@@ ven@@ der in Prov@@ ence is effectively endangered , because in recent years the plant has been subjected to the effects of climate change that brought a lot less rain in the spring and mostly in the autumn .
This affects the lif@@ esp@@ an of la@@ ven@@ der .
There &apos;s also a small c@@ ic@@ ada , a micro-@@ bacteria trans@@ mitting lea@@ f hop@@ per , and in very dry weather there are lots of them . &quot;
And a lot is at stake .
As well as attracting holi@@ day@@ makers , la@@ ven@@ der oil is highly sought after for per@@ fu@@ me and co@@ s@@ me@@ tics .
E@@ ric Cha@@ is@@ se said : &quot; Instead of having very long plant e@@ ars with a number of large flow@@ ers , we have smaller ones , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened .
So we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
S@@ olutions being looked at include better water distribution and slowing down ev@@ ap@@ oration from the soil , but also spra@@ ying the plants with a protective mix of cla@@ y and water and developing varieties more resistant to dry conditions .
Compared to the sci@@ -@@ fi elements in the movie , the two lead actors said that it was the movie ’ s plot that attracted them .
On the after@@ no@@ on of September 5 , West China City D@@ aily reporters con@@ secu@@ tively inter@@ viewed numerous re@@ now@@ ned person@@ alities in the cross talk circle , as well as two cross talk arti@@ st@@ es . What was surprising was that they were unanimously silent most of the time .
One is a Sil@@ ver Bear B@@ est Ac@@ tor , the other , an up@@ -and-@@ coming young actor ; “ Gu@@ il@@ ty of M@@ ind ” is the first partnership between Li@@ ao F@@ an and Li Y@@ i@@ f@@ en@@ g .
A journalist &apos;s murder underscores growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the wee@@ kly newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce normally meets on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ days to review their plans for coverage of the most recent may@@ hem wrought in Sin@@ alo@@ a state by organized crime , corrupt officials and cease@@ less drug wars .
But on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they &apos;@@ ve come together to talk about security .
It &apos;s important to change their rout@@ ines , they are told .
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer : to take their children with them to the office , which was the target of a g@@ ren@@ ade attack in 2009 , or to leave them at home .
Security experts have written three words on a black@@ board at the front of the room : adversaries , neutr@@ als , allies .
They ask the reporters to suggest names for each colum@@ n - no proof is needed , perceptions and g@@ ut feelings are enough .
There are drug-@@ traffic@@ kers , politicians , business@@ people , journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the car@@ t@@ els , a cat@@ alo@@ g of vil@@ la@@ ins who make the job of covering Mexico &apos;s chaos peril@@ ous .
There is no resp@@ ite from the violence , and as bodies pile up across the country , more and more of them are journalists : at least 25 since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a Nieto took office in December 2012 , according to the Committee to Pro@@ tect Jour@@ n@@ alists ; 58@@ 9 under federal protection after attacks and threats ; and so far this year , at least seven dead in seven states .
Among the latest is their edit@@ or and inspiration , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce co-@@ founder J@@ avi@@ er Val@@ de@@ z Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; The greatest error is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ de@@ z wrote in one of his many books on nar@@ co-@@ violence .
His absence is felt deeply , although his presence is everywhere - a large pho@@ to of Val@@ de@@ z disp@@ laying his middle f@@ inger , with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the fac@@ ade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building ; two reporters on their 30@@ s , A@@ ar@@ on I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ re@@ z , wear T@@ -@@ shir@@ ts that display his sm@@ iling , be@@ spectac@@ led face or his trade@@ mark Panama hat .
The work@@ shop takes place less than two months after his death ; the reporters discuss their shared trauma , their night@@ ma@@ res , in@@ s@@ om@@ nia , parano@@ ia .
Although a special federal prosecutor &apos;s office was established in 2010 to handle the journalists &apos; cases , it has only prosecu@@ ted two , according to the Committee to Pro@@ tect Jour@@ n@@ alists .
As with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders tied to drug trafficking and organized crime each year , the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
At Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they persist in covering the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , though they are heart@@ broken , though the ter@@ rain is more tre@@ ach@@ erous now .
Without information on the killers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security , says I@@ bar@@ ra , is of little use .
&quot; It &apos;s very foolish to waste my time in this work@@ shop , &quot; he says .
&quot; As long as we don &apos;t know why , you distrust everyone . &quot;
On the morning of May 15 , Val@@ de@@ z left the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce office in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
He managed to drive just a couple blocks before his red To@@ y@@ ota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men ; he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times , presumably for the name of the paper - which transl@@ ates as T@@ wel@@ f@@ th River .
The gun@@ man drove away in his car and cra@@ shed it nearby .
Val@@ de@@ z was 50 years old .
He left a wife and two adult children .
Rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
But on the subject of Val@@ de@@ z , there &apos;s practically nothing but silence .
Since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has been one of the country &apos;s bloo@@ di@@ est battle@@ grounds as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum .
Never mind that someone or several people are shot dead in the street every day in Sin@@ alo@@ a , or that the cem@@ e@@ tery is filled with or@@ nate , two-@@ story ma@@ us@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings , larger than many homes for the living .
For@@ get for a minute that a state of &quot; calm &quot; is when just one car@@ tel is in control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug-@@ trafficking routes to the United States .
Despite that , and the fact that Val@@ de@@ z was in@@ timately aware of the per@@ ils of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ que@@ z , 60 , a co-@@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , is w@@ rac@@ ked with guilt for failing to protect his friend .
He believes two errors contributed to the killing .
First there was the publication in February of an interview with Dam@@ as@@ o Lo@@ pe@@ z , a leader of one of the rival car@@ tel factions at war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
The piece may have angered the sons ; suspected gang members bought up every cop@@ y of the e@@ dition as soon as they were delivered to new@@ s@@ stands .
The second mistake was not forcing Val@@ de@@ z to leave the country for his own safety after the se@@ iz@@ ure of another newspaper that carried the same story .
Val@@ de@@ z was a leg@@ end in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
He &apos;@@ d survived for so long , his friends and colleagues assumed he &apos;@@ d always be there .
He was a veter@@ an repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ est@@ e in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in creating Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , selling $ 50 shares .
In Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to do journalism without tou@@ ching the nar@@ co issue , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ que@@ z .
Over time the paper earned a reputation for brave and honest coverage , and sales and advertising increased .
Re@@ porters loved being able to publish hard-@@ hitting investigations without fear of censorship , and readers were fas@@ c@@ inated by a publication where they could read stories nobody else d@@ ared to cover .
E@@ ight years after Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce was founded , it won the presti@@ gious M@@ aria Mo@@ ors C@@ abo@@ t a@@ ward for coverage in Latin America .
That same year , Val@@ de@@ z won the International P@@ ress Freedom A@@ ward of the Committee to Pro@@ tect Jour@@ n@@ alists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug story wherever it led .
He freely acknowledged that he was frigh@@ tened .
&quot; I want to carry on living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J a@@ ward .
Drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October , in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ en@@ to TV .
&quot; You have to assume the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play du@@ m@@ b .
I don &apos;t want to be asked , &apos; What were you doing in the face of so much death ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ? &apos; &quot;
The Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce staff misses Val@@ de@@ z , the jo@@ ke@@ ster who s@@ wor@@ e like a long@@ sh@@ ore@@ man , the friend generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
They relied on his routine .
He would always wear his hat .
He would go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar across from the office , and would always sit at the same table .
Now , they ask : Was his love of routine his down@@ fall ?
His death also has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and stay alive .
&quot; They don &apos;t like it if you mess with their women , their children , their clean businesses , their cl@@ an@@ dest@@ ine air@@ stri@@ ps &quot; used to move drugs .
&quot; Those things were off-@@ limits , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ que@@ z .
The result is , even in the best of times , a high-level of self-@@ censorship and self-@@ preser@@ vation .
Tru@@ sting one &apos;s instinc@@ ts .
If it sm@@ el@@ ls wrong , stay away .
The trouble , said Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce edit@@ or An@@ d@@ res V@@ il@@ lar@@ real , is that &quot; sm@@ ell is a sense that can be fo@@ oled ... and then the thing with J@@ avi@@ er happened . &quot;
The old rules , he and others say , no longer apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as they don &apos;t in Tam@@ au@@ li@@ p@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ er@@ re@@ ro and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smugg@@ ling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials .
The landscape constantly shifts .
In the room where Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce staff met for security training , suddenly no cell@@ phones were allowed ; days before , it was revealed that sp@@ y@@ ware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
Out@@ side , two police officers sought relief from the 10@@ 4-@@ degree ( 40 Celsius ) heat in the sha@@ de of a tre@@ e .
They were as@@ signed by the state government to guard Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s offices , hous@@ ed in a four-@@ story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
Hal@@ f-@@ jo@@ kingly , some of the reporters won@@ dered whether these officers are among the 50 percent of c@@ ops whom the governor himself has said are not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
It has been months since the reporters have gone into the moun@@ tain@@ ous countryside , where the drug gang@@ s are in de facto control .
For this week &apos;s e@@ dition Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce was looking at three main stories .
There was the killing of former bo@@ xing great Ju@@ li@@ o C@@ es@@ ar Cha@@ vez &apos;s brother in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
They also had an expose on government spending concentrated in the governor &apos;s home@@ town .
And there was a group kidn@@ apping in one of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an &apos;s most expensive restaurants , a block from the prosecutor &apos;s office .
There was no official word on who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it happened , so caution set in when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaur@@ ant is a favorite of both drug traffic@@ kers and authorities .
A repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaur@@ ant was registered under the name of a politician belong@@ ing to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party , or PRI , which dominated all levels of politics for nearly all of the last century .
Recently several PRI governors have been accused of corruption in high-@@ profile cases .
V@@ il@@ lar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about prior incidents in that loc@@ ale , including one in which a son of &quot; El C@@ hap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military raid .
Just months before , readers would have looked to Val@@ de@@ z &apos;s colum@@ n for the best-@@ sourced information about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; Before , we would have already known what happened , &quot; said V@@ il@@ lar@@ real , 46 , n@@ ick@@ named &quot; El F@@ lac@@ o &quot; for his s@@ lender build .
&quot; Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken . &quot;
Val@@ de@@ z &apos;s office has been re@@ pur@@ posed as a storage room for signs and stic@@ kers prote@@ sting journalist killings , as staff have become something they never expected to be : activists on behalf of the press .
Re@@ por@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ re@@ z gra@@ bbed a few of the signs and headed out the next morning for a demonstration at the local prosecutor &apos;s office over yet another journalist .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared in the western state of Mic@@ ho@@ ac@@ an three days after Val@@ de@@ z was killed .
A burned body has been discovered and officials say it is his , based on DNA tests .
Nation@@ wide , journalists have become more vocal , scra@@ w@@ ling &quot; SO@@ S P@@ ress &quot; on side@@ wal@@ ks and buildings in organized protests .
On this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ que@@ z is away in Washington , trying to rally international support for justice in the Val@@ de@@ z case .
At a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a the day after Val@@ de@@ z was killed , Ram@@ i@@ re@@ z accused authorities of sp@@ ying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth .
She has since asked to be reas@@ signed from covering the government , concerned that her anger has hurt her obj@@ ec@@ tivity .
Val@@ de@@ z had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are &quot; surrounded &quot; by organized crime , compli@@ cit government officials and an in@@ different society .
In his last book , &quot; N@@ ar@@ co-@@ journalism , &quot; he wrote that reporters are being killed not just by drug gang@@ s but on the order of politicians and security forces in ca@@ ho@@ ots with organized crime .
The media watch@@ dog group Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials .
&quot; In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up , &quot; Ram@@ i@@ re@@ z said .
Clearly , the mur@@ ders have a ch@@ illing effect .
No one for@@ gets the death six years ago of blog@@ ger M@@ aria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ li@@ p@@ as .
Her body was found along with a note pur@@ por@@ tedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as car@@ tel : &quot; Here I am because of my reports . &quot;
A computer ke@@ y@@ board and head@@ phones lay next to her se@@ vered head .
Some outlets have opted to close , such as the newspaper El Nor@@ te , in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a , after the killing of cor@@ respond@@ ent Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ va Bre@@ ach in March .
Others keep going , as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ ev@@ o L@@ are@@ do did following the killing of its director in 2004 .
In 2010 , Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ are@@ z addressed the drug car@@ t@@ els publicly with a front-@@ page edit@@ orial ti@@ tled , &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country .
It &apos;s a w@@ ren@@ ching decision .
It &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and they still s@@ can the streets , looking for danger .
And sometimes , they are hun@@ ted down , as apparently was photo@@ graph@@ er Ru@@ b@@ en E@@ sp@@ in@@ os@@ a , who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in a Mexico City apar@@ tment three months after fleeing Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
For those who stay behind and continue the work , it &apos;s a daily dance of high-@@ risk decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra - who once wanted to be a po@@ et - ad@@ mits that covering the drug trade sc@@ a@@ res him .
&quot; Mexico is going to hell , and that &apos;s why I became a repor@@ ter , &quot; he said .
At mid@@ night on a recent Fri@@ day , with the latest issue already put to bed , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce ed@@ itors sat on the side@@ walk outside the office , drinking be@@ er , when all at once , their phones began to bu@@ z@@ z .
A series of sho@@ ot@@ outs involving gang rivals and security forces near the be@@ ach resort city of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
The war continued to escal@@ ate , as was promised by a series of car@@ tel messages discovered in the area .
From the curb , via cell@@ phone , they put the news up on Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s web@@ site .
The front page would have to be changed the next day .
Si@@ ren@@ s w@@ ailed nearby - another sho@@ ot@@ out in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ que@@ z g@@ lan@@ ced over at the police officers standing guard to see if they were al@@ ert .
If they were at all afraid , they didn &apos;t show it .
B@@ ene@@ ath the massive portra@@ it of their newspaper &apos;s fallen founder , his middle f@@ inger disp@@ layed for all of Sin@@ alo@@ a to see , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce was following in his foot@@ steps .
&quot; How can you even think of closing , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ que@@ z said , &quot; when the same day J@@ avi@@ er was killed the inter@@ n asked me to send her out to report on the street ? &quot;
S@@ ize of China ’ s self drive tourism market may exceed RM@@ B@@ 1 trillion by 2020
&#91; Ab@@ str@@ act &#93; Against the general backdrop of consumption upgrading and widespread popularity of free-@@ and-@@ easy travel , self drive tourism has received support from national policies , and is welcomed by an increasing number of consumers .
At the same time however , the self drive travel market , the size of which is expected to exceed RM@@ B@@ 1 trillion , is confronted with twin challenges .
Against the general backdrop of consumption upgrading and widespread popularity of free-@@ and-@@ easy travel , self drive tourism has received support from national policies , and is welcomed by an increasing number of consumers .
At the same time however , the self drive travel market , the size of which is expected to exceed RM@@ B@@ 1 trillion , is confronted with twin challenges . On the one hand , the development of the self drive travel industry is out of step with market demand . Sel@@ f drive travel organiz@@ ers such as self drive clubs and travel agents are confronted with meager profits . On the other hand , self drive travel a@@ e confronted with infrastructure and services that are still in their infant stages .
Ac@@ counting for 60 % of total tourists in domestic tourism , with market size expected to exceed RM@@ B@@ 1 trillion
In 2016 , domestic tourism num@@ bered some 4.@@ 44 billion persons , with self drive travel accounting for approximately 60 % of total tourists in domestic tourism . By 2020 , the size of the self drive travel market is expected to exceed RM@@ B@@ 1 trillion .
St@@ atis@@ tics concerning the number of persons engaged in self drive travel published by China T@@ ou@@ rism A@@ ut@@ om@@ ob@@ ile And Cru@@ ise Association showed that the number of persons engaged in self drive travel has continued to grow over the last five years . The share of such tourists as a proportion to domestic tourists has stabilized at above 50 % .
At the same time , all regions as well as the State have shown greater concern and support for self drive tourism , this new emerging sector . From 2016 to 2017 , a sle@@ w of policies and regulations relevant to vehicles for self drive travel , and mo@@ tor@@ home and camp@@ ing tourism have been pro@@ mul@@ g@@ ated .
In July 2017 , eight government agencies including the China National T@@ ou@@ rism Administration and the State General Administration of S@@ ports jointly issued the “ Pl@@ ans for the Development of A@@ ut@@ om@@ ob@@ ile C@@ amp@@ sites for Sel@@ f D@@ ri@@ ve S@@ ports ” . In the same month , in the “ Action Plan for Ad@@ van@@ cing Qu@@ ality En@@ han@@ cement and Up@@ gra@@ ding in R@@ ural Tra@@ vel Development ( 2017 ) “ jointly printed and circul@@ ated by 14 government agencies including the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance , self drive travel was mentioned as a priority .
The introduction of policy measures has provided opportunities and policy guidance for the development of domestic self drive travel .
Sel@@ f drive travel clubs make meager profits ; complete industry chain is key
Although there is enormous potential in the self drive travel market , and active guidance from national policy measures , the self drive travel industry is still at its inf@@ ancy stage .
According to the “ 201@@ 6-@@ 2017 Annual Report on the Development of China ’ s Sel@@ f D@@ ri@@ ve Tra@@ vel Indu@@ stry ” , domestic self drive travel clubs , automobile clubs and automobile enthusi@@ asts clubs number in the thousands , tourists who ar@@ range their own travel it@@ iner@@ ary account for a larger proportion . The proportion of tourists who join automobile enthusi@@ asts clubs , self drive travel clubs and other such entities only account for about 15 % .
Meanwhile , there are only a handful of online tour companies and traditional travel agencies that develop propri@@ etary products for self drive travel . Many online travel platforms only sell self drive travel products provided by some suppliers . Some self drive travel clubs are also key suppliers .
In terms of organizing self drive travel activities , this en@@ comp@@ ass various aspects including “ board , lo@@ d@@ ging , transport , travel , shopping , entertainment ” . Fra@@ g@@ ment@@ ation is high , and up@@ stream supply chain heavy . There is also significant random@@ ness in tou@@ rist spending .
Li Gu@@ an@@ ji@@ e , founder and CEO of Beijing X@@ T@@ X Au@@ to Club , believes that self drive travel clubs are similar to travel agencies in essence . The primary earnings model at the initial stage are mainly based on off@@ line activities . The core areas are self drive travel route products and guide services .
However , there is significant product homo@@ gene@@ ity in route products within the self drive sector , and the standard of guide services is mixed . Sel@@ f drive travel clubs are again confronted with the need to restructure .
It is quite apparent that self drive travel is not an independent industry in and of itself . Rather , it is an inter-@@ regional and -@@ industry ecosystem based on movement characteristics of self drive travel . The creation of a complete industry chain is key .
Experts have pointed out that in addition to basic tou@@ rist consumption , experience is a more important consumption element .
Hence , with regards to the development of the self drive travel industry , the experience feature should be enhanced . A “ self drive travel + ” theme as well as self drive travel product IP should be developed .
S@@ cen@@ ic routes are not merely roads , and automobile camp@@ sites should not merely meet board and lo@@ d@@ ging requirements
Con@@ fron@@ ted with the rise in self drive travel , the development of self drive travel infrastructure is similarly still fairly ru@@ di@@ mentary .
Li Gu@@ an@@ ji@@ e pointed out that scen@@ ic travel routes are not merely a road . Rather , traffic and tourism elements should be integrated into it . However , building roads and tourism are the responsibility of two separate department . The increase in tourism element by transport departments are still stuck at the level of building rest rooms , information centers , public@@ ity bul@@ le@@ tin boards and other such facilities . Their degree of bon@@ ding with the tourism is low .
These could draw lessons from the building experience of the re@@ now@@ ned self drive route of “ US Rou@@ te 66 ” ,
The design of scen@@ ic routes is no longer the most direct and fastest route from the place of origin to the destination but ad@@ h@@ ering to the design concept of “ experience the jo@@ y of driving ” so as to provide self drive travel@@ ers the best enjo@@ y@@ ment of beautiful sc@@ ener@@ y along the route . S@@ cen@@ ic routes are able to connect spots and fac@@ ets of the travel landscape . These would help retain the historical value and cultural value of the ec@@ o-@@ tourism resources along the route . Meanwhile , various them@@ atic activities may also be held to enhance tou@@ rist participation and rec@@ re@@ ation experience , creating economic benefit for the local tourism industry .
In addition to scen@@ ic routes , camp@@ sites are also important supporting facilities for self drive travel .
However , a Beijing News repor@@ ter understands from self drive travel@@ ers that few consumers would choose to stay at camp@@ sites .
They believe that many camp@@ sites are infrastructure and can only meet board and lo@@ d@@ ging requirements . Con@@ si@@ dered low class with dul@@ l product features , they are unable to meet the multi-@@ fac@@ eted demands of self drive travel .
An industry in@@ sider who wi@@ shed to remain an@@ onymous said that a few years ago , enterprises operate camp@@ site mostly for the purpose of acquiring land . After they acquire the land , follow@@ -up development of complementary infrastructure and services have not caught up . These operators are lo@@ ss-@@ making , and do not have l@@ ater@@ -@@ stage capital inj@@ ection . Hence , providing corresponding complementary products proved very difficult .
Consumer groups
Data published by the China T@@ ou@@ rism A@@ ut@@ om@@ ob@@ ile And Cru@@ ise Association in 2017 showed that in terms of age , self drive travel@@ ers are concentrated in the 21@@ -@@ 40 age group , mostly in the 3@@ 1-@@ 40 co@@ hor@@ t . This group has a certain level of income , and are relatively demanding in terms of custom@@ ized travel . Many are family oriented customers .
A survey in lo@@ d@@ ging revealed that self drive travel@@ ers prefer non-@@ standard lo@@ d@@ ging .
In terms of self drive travel categories , driving in neighboring areas is the pre@@ dominant category , accounting for 84 . 32 % .
Sel@@ f drive travel overseas is a dream for many , but the proportion is still relatively small .
Meanwhile , with higher consumption demand , tourists who enjoyed self drive “ tour of sigh@@ ts ” have begun to change their opinion . Instead of “ ali@@ gh@@ ting to take pho@@ tos , and bo@@ ar@@ ding to sleep ” during the self drive travel process , they are now more concerned with the travel experience and process .
D@@ in@@ os@@ au@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to ev@@ ade its enemies
At first glance , it looks like a stat@@ ue albeit a terri@@ fying one .
Now researchers have revealed the first findings from the incre@@ di@@ ble r@@ hin@@ o-@@ sized cre@@ ature found by a Canadian min@@ er were so well preser@@ ved experts have described it as &apos; the Mon@@ a Lis@@ a of din@@ o@@ sa@@ urs &apos; .
It was so well preser@@ ved , they were even able to determine the col@@ our of its sc@@ al@@ y skin was a red@@ dish b@@ rown - and say it had something of a &apos; troubled past &apos; .
The report in the journal Current Bi@@ ology described it as &apos; the best-@@ preser@@ ved ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ os@@ au@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ os@@ au@@ r spec@@ im@@ ens in the world . &apos; 
The fossil is a new@@ found species of no@@ do@@ s@@ au@@ r , which lived mid@@ way through the Cre@@ t@@ ace@@ ous period , between 110 million and 11@@ 2 million years ago .
It &apos;s incre@@ di@@ ble well preser@@ ved state has stun@@ ned researchers , who describe it as &apos; truly remark@@ ab@@ le@@ &apos;
The arm@@ ou@@ red plan@@ t-@@ e@@ ater is the best preser@@ ved fossil of its kind ever found , according to reports in National Geo@@ graphic .
It was found by Sha@@ w@@ n Fun@@ k , when he was dig@@ ging at the Sun@@ c@@ or M@@ illen@@ ium M@@ ine near For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in northern Al@@ ber@@ ta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 .
He hit something which seemed out of place from the surrounding rock , and decided to take a closer look .
The fossil he un@@ covered was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Mu@@ seum of Pal@@ e@@ on@@ to@@ logy .
They spent the next six years working on un@@ covering the be@@ ast within the 2,@@ 500@@ -@@ pound ( 1,@@ 100 k@@ g ) lu@@ mp of earth .
After all that hard work , the finished result is now ready to be unveiled .
&apos;@@ If you just squ@@ int your eyes a bit , you could almost believe it was sle@@ eping , &apos; said lead author Cal@@ e@@ b Brown , a scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Mu@@ seum where the cre@@ ature is on display .
&apos;@@ It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preser@@ ved din@@ os@@ au@@ r spec@@ im@@ ens - the Mon@@ a Lis@@ a of din@@ o@@ sa@@ urs . &apos; 
By studying its skin , researchers found that this plan@@ t-@@ e@@ ater , though covered in arm@@ or and resemb@@ ling a walking tank , likely faced a significant threat from me@@ at-@@ eating din@@ o@@ sa@@ urs .
The heavily arm@@ ou@@ red din@@ os@@ au@@ r used red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide from pre@@ d@@ ators , and employed a shi@@ el@@ ding techni@@ que known as counter-@@ sha@@ ding , which is also used by many modern@@ -@@ day animals .
This would have allowed it to better bl@@ end into its surr@@ oun@@ dings and ev@@ ade its enemies , experts say , suggesting it was pre@@ yed on by larger din@@ o@@ sa@@ urs .
The 1@@ 10-@@ m@@ illi@@ on-@@ year-old cre@@ ature , part of the no@@ do@@ s@@ au@@ r family , first hit headlines in May and is now on view at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Mu@@ seum of Pal@@ a@@ e@@ on@@ to@@ logy .
Re@@ search@@ ers have now studied and named the be@@ ast B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mar@@ k@@ mit@@ ch@@ ell@@ i after mu@@ seum tech@@ nic@@ ian Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours pa@@ inst@@ ak@@ ingly un@@ covering it .
The amaz@@ ing preser@@ vation of the spec@@ im@@ en made it possible for D@@ r Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of sc@@ ales and arm@@ our across its body .
They discovered counter@@ sha@@ ding , a common method of def@@ ence in the animal k@@ ingdom , which means the top of the cre@@ ature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
Although counter@@ sha@@ ding is common , the findings come as surprise because B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta &apos;s size far exceeds that of counter@@ sha@@ ded animals alive today .
It suggests the din@@ os@@ au@@ r was hun@@ ted by enough pressure me@@ at-@@ eating din@@ o@@ sa@@ urs that evolution fav@@ ou@@ red conce@@ al@@ ment over confrontation as a means of survival .
But most contemporary animals that have counter@@ sha@@ ding -@@ - think de@@ er , ze@@ br@@ as or arm@@ ad@@ il@@ los -@@ - are much smaller and more vulnerable as pre@@ y , signaling that this no@@ do@@ s@@ au@@ r faced a real struggle to survive .
&apos;@@ Str@@ ong pre@@ dation on a massive , heav@@ il@@ y-@@ ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ os@@ au@@ r illustrates just how dangerous the din@@ os@@ au@@ r pre@@ d@@ ators of the Cre@@ t@@ ace@@ ous must have been , &apos; said Brown .
Ch@@ em@@ ical analysis of organic comp@@ ounds in its sc@@ ales also reveal that the din@@ os@@ au@@ r &apos;s skin would have been red@@ dish b@@ rown .
Scientists are continuing to study the animal for clu@@ es about its life , including its preser@@ ved g@@ ut cont@@ ents to find out what it ate for its last me@@ al .
They believe that when the din@@ os@@ au@@ r died , it fell into a river and was swept out to sea , where it san@@ k on its back to the ocean floor .
At that time , Al@@ ber@@ ta was as warm as south Florida is today , and rivers and oceans likely spread far further in@@ land than they do now .
&apos;@@ This no@@ do@@ s@@ au@@ r is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in preser@@ ved sc@@ al@@ y skin , yet is also preser@@ ved in three dimensions , retaining the original shape of the animal , &apos; said Brown .
&apos;@@ The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did back in the Early Cre@@ t@@ ace@@ ous .
You don &apos;t need to use much imagination to recon@@ struc@@ t it ; if you just squ@@ int your eyes a bit , you could almost believe it was sle@@ eping . &apos; 
The Cre@@ t@@ ace@@ ous was a time when giant ther@@ o@@ po@@ ds , me@@ at-@@ eating din@@ o@@ sa@@ urs that stood on two leg@@ s , ro@@ amed the Earth .
Although the king of them all , Ty@@ ran@@ no@@ sa@@ ur@@ us re@@ x , lived millions of years after B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ ou@@ red din@@ os@@ au@@ r may have been hun@@ ted by some of its formidable ance@@ stors .
They include Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ tho@@ sa@@ ur@@ us , a 38@@ ft ( 11@@ .@@ 5@@ m ) long mon@@ ster weigh@@ ing six ton@@ nes .
The scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was w@@ ashed out to sea after it died and m@@ um@@ mi@@ fied in mu@@ d .
The cre@@ ature was found by Sha@@ w@@ n Fun@@ k , when he was dig@@ ging at the M@@ illen@@ ium M@@ ine near For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in northern Al@@ ber@@ ta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 .
According to the mu@@ seum , it is the best preser@@ ved arm@@ ou@@ red din@@ os@@ au@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is complete from the sn@@ out to hi@@ ps .
The cre@@ atures were around 18 feet ( five met@@ res ) long on average , and weighted up to 3,000 p@@ ounds ( 1,@@ 300 k@@ g ) .
It feat@@ ured two 20-@@ in@@ ch-@@ long spi@@ kes which pro@@ tru@@ ded from its shoul@@ ders .
The researchers believe that the this ar@@ mo@@ red plan@@ t-@@ e@@ ater lum@@ bered through what is now western Canada , until a floo@@ ded river swept it into open sea .
But the din@@ os@@ au@@ r &apos;s under@@ sea bu@@ ri@@ al preser@@ ved its arm@@ or in ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite detail .
The fossi@@ li@@ sed remains of this particular spec@@ im@@ en are so well preser@@ ved that rem@@ n@@ ants of skin still cover bu@@ mp@@ y arm@@ our pl@@ ates along the din@@ os@@ au@@ r &apos;s sk@@ ull .
As Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko wrote for National Geo@@ graphic , such level of preser@@ vation &apos; is a rare as winning the lo@@ t@@ tery .
The more I look at it , the more min@@ d-@@ bo@@ gg@@ ling it becomes .
F@@ os@@ si@@ li@@ zed rem@@ n@@ ants of skin still cover the bu@@ mp@@ y arm@@ or pl@@ ates do@@ tting the animal &apos;s sk@@ ull .
Its right fore@@ foot lies by its side , its five dig@@ its sp@@ layed upward .
I can count the sc@@ ales on its sole . &apos; 
Re@@ porters understand that adding alg@@ inate , hum@@ ic ac@@ id and am@@ ino ac@@ id nutri@@ ent car@@ ri@@ ers of natural or plant sources into the production process of u@@ rea would change modi@@ fy and enhance the benefit of traditional u@@ rea .

The total number of security personnel is double that of the 2012 London Olympics .
In order to ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics , Brazil will start the largest ever security link@@ age plan .
Earlier , Brazil government has said that a total of 8@@ 5,000 troops and poli@@ ces , including 20,000 troops and 65@@ ,000 poli@@ ces , will fight together for the security of the Olympics .
Most troops will be responsible for safeguarding the Olympic ven@@ ues , while the new 3,000 troops will be responsible for the security of international airports , sub@@ way stations and streets .
The poli@@ ces will pat@@ ro@@ l around other areas of the city , including sub@@ ways , bus@@ es and streets .
It is reported that 6,000 soldiers have arrived in Rio and provided security services for the Olympics .
In addition to the four competition areas , they will also pat@@ ro@@ l airports and main roads connecting airports to the Olympic ven@@ ues .
A@@ pp@@ rais@@ al mechanisms in the services sector are nothing new . The key to having these app@@ rais@@ al mechanisms play an effective role is to have more effective supervision , rather than being a mere for@@ ma@@ lity .
How one activist came to learn the answer to the question : &apos; W@@ ho@@ se Stre@@ ets ? &apos;
On Aug@@ . 9 , 2014 , Brit@@ t@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken to her core .
Just a day after arri@@ ving in New York City on a trip , the St. Lou@@ is native sat on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b she was ren@@ ting , sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone .
She stum@@ bled upon a post from someone from high school .
&quot; The police just killed an 18 year old k@@ id and he &apos;s still laying in the street , &quot; it read .
Conf@@ used , notic@@ ing no one else on her feed had po@@ sted the information , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
A user with the handle @ The@@ e@@ P@@ har@@ o@@ ah was being constantly re@@ t@@ wee@@ ted onto her tim@@ el@@ ine .
The St. Lou@@ is@@ -@@ area ra@@ pper was li@@ ve-@@ twe@@ eting the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18@@ -year-old killed by a white police officer in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , M@@ o .
He po@@ sted a picture of Brown &apos;s life@@ less body stretched out in the street , where it would stay for four hours .
&quot; This is wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought to herself .
But death was nothing new for her and her community .
She put down her phone only to return later that ev@@ ening to twe@@ ets about people gathering on Can@@ field D@@ ri@@ ve .
There were pho@@ tos of police tape and people yel@@ ling , and of a gu@@ y claiming to be Brown &apos;s father holding a sign that read , &quot; Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a bar@@ king dog .
In another video , a different co@@ p , she said , coc@@ ked his ri@@ fle and scre@@ amed , &quot; I &apos;@@ ll kill all you ... animals . &quot;
&quot; &apos; This is not usual , &apos; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l rec@@ alled saying .
&quot; &apos; This isn &apos;t the type of murder that we &apos;@@ ve become used to and can call typical . &apos; 
In that moment I felt ch@@ ills .
I was angry and c@@ rying . &quot;
She boo@@ ked a return flight and went home the next day .
After landing at 11 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , she picked up her 6-@@ year-old daughter from her d@@ ad &apos;s house and decided the two of them would head to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on the next morning .
What happened , to Fer@@ rel@@ l and to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on in the following almost three years is the subject of a new docum@@ entary , &quot; W@@ ho@@ se Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the@@ at@@ ers Aug@@ . 11 .
It &apos;s a tale of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience from the v@@ ant@@ age point of the people who live in the community and pac@@ ked the streets demanding answers .
As Fer@@ rel@@ l drove to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on with her daughter , who was wearing a fl@@ oral d@@ ress and mat@@ ching crow@@ n , the two re@@ visited a conversation they &apos;@@ d had countless times before that morning &quot; about the black experience and black condition . &quot;
&quot; You remember how I taught you about when black people had to fight for what they believed in ? &quot; she rec@@ alled saying .
&quot; We &apos;@@ re going to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on right now because the police killed an 18@@ -year-old boy and it wasn &apos;t right .
I couldn &apos;t not take her , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later .
&quot; This happening today is a culmin@@ ation of ... that has happened in the past .
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it .
She needs to be well developed in the area of not just activism and organizing but knowing the different la@@ yers of the black experience and the black condition and what we must do to get free , to free ourselves .
Even if I &apos;@@ m fortunate enough to provide her an experience where she doesn &apos;t personally experience blat@@ ant racism , she is no different than the next black wom@@ an-@@ child .
I feel like I would be doing her a dis@@ service to shi@@ eld her from that . &quot;
The first stop when they arrived in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on was on South Flor@@ is@@ s@@ ant Road , a site across from the police department that became a camp@@ ground of sorts as the activists awa@@ ited word of O@@ ffic@@ er D@@ arren Wilson &apos;s eventual non-@@ indic@@ tment .
There Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter linked up with a local business owner who was making s@@ ack lun@@ ches .
They prepared bag@@ s and helped pass them out to protesters .
S@@ low@@ ly , a new type of activism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; My activism completely transformed after Aug@@ . 9 , &quot; she said , noting that while an under@@ gra@@ d at the University of Mis@@ sou@@ ri@@ -@@ S@@ t . Lou@@ is , she was president of the Min@@ ority Stu@@ dent N@@ ur@@ ses Ass@@ n@@ . and focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
It all just came . &quot;
We@@ e@@ ks later , Fer@@ rel@@ l met S@@ ab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ayan , one of the film &apos;s co-@@ directors , during an ev@@ ening demonstration .
Fol@@ ayan said she and her director of photo@@ graphy Luc@@ as Al@@ var@@ ad@@ o-@@ Far@@ ra@@ r &quot; just wanted to document &quot; what was happening .
A question came to Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s mind : &quot; Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit ? &quot;
That skepticism was informed by countless instances of people - often white - coming into a community to profit off its pain and resilience .
As Fol@@ ayan explained in a recent interview , &quot; We had heard that people who are born and raised in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on were not having their voices centered , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ayan had already linked up with co-@@ director Dam@@ on D@@ av@@ is , an area arti@@ st known for his activism around death row in@@ m@@ ates .
His involvement ende@@ ared Fer@@ rel@@ l to the project , along with six other loc@@ als the &quot; W@@ ho@@ se Stre@@ ets ? &quot; team followed in the years after Brown &apos;s shooting .
&quot; This docum@@ entary is not some@@ body speaking for us or speaking to us , it &apos;s us speaking , &quot; D@@ av@@ is said .
&quot; That was the main thing for me , how these people will be represented , because that &apos;s how I will be represented . &quot;
While the goal wasn &apos;t to focus on Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s experience - in an effort to show that the movement is &quot; not about a mes@@ si@@ ah leader but a community coming together , &quot; Fol@@ ayan said - she proved to be the most open of the film &apos;s participants .
As a result , &quot; W@@ ho@@ se Stre@@ ets ? &quot; documents surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s life , like falling in love and mar@@ rying her wife .
&quot; I felt like I was n@@ aked , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , lau@@ gh@@ ing about the first time she saw the finished product .
&quot; But I understood that with doing this work and human@@ izing black fol@@ ks , there has to be a level of vulnerability . &quot;
Moreover , Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s story reiter@@ ates and re-@@ centers the role of black que@@ er women in the broader Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
Two of the movement &apos;s three foun@@ ders - who coined # B@@ lack@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter on social media in the aftermath of the 2012 killing of black teen Tra@@ y@@ von Martin - identify as que@@ er .
&quot; Black que@@ er women in leadership has sustained the movement overall , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and that &apos;s because we &apos;@@ re constantly at battle on multiple fronts .
Black que@@ er women have to bear the br@@ unt of it all . &quot;
Fol@@ ayan agreed noting that &quot; the movement is really up@@ held by black women and a lot of que@@ er black women . &quot;
She insists , however , that &quot; this is not some affir@@ m@@ ative action type of thing &quot; where Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the film &apos;s heart because of her identities .
&quot; She was the person who was galvan@@ izing this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; It &apos;s not a coincidence though she was on the front lines , because living life at those inter@@ sec@@ tions as a black que@@ er woman , you have so much on the line .
You can feel her energy through the scre@@ en . &quot;
Meanwhile , back in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , the news cam@@ er@@ as are long gone but fraught racial ties between the community and police persist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ more years for blocking a highway during a demonstration .
She describes the soci@@ o-@@ political atmosphere of the area she calls home simply : &quot; A mess . &quot;
Still , she cl@@ ings to a ch@@ ant she &apos;s committed to memory since taking to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on &apos;s streets a full three years ago .
&quot; It is our duty to fight for our freedom .
It is our duty to win .
We must love and support each other .
We have nothing to lose but our chains . &quot;
On@@ line trans@@ lation services were actually already available on the Internet a decade ago , and in fact , a very long time ago , there was a prevalent view that “ machines will replace human trans@@ lation ” .
A Bec@@ oming Res@@ emb@@ lance : arti@@ st creates portra@@ its using Ch@@ el@@ sea Man@@ ning &apos;s DNA
In the center of the room at New York &apos;s Fri@@ d@@ man G@@ all@@ ery are multiple faces - white , black and b@@ rown , each bearing an almost imper@@ cep@@ tible resemb@@ lance to one another - suspended on wi@@ res from the ceiling .
The 30 portra@@ its were created by the arti@@ st He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y-@@ H@@ ag@@ bor@@ g from che@@ ek sw@@ ab@@ s and ha@@ ir cli@@ pp@@ ings sent to her by Ch@@ el@@ sea Man@@ ning .
Man@@ ning sent the cli@@ pp@@ ings from the For@@ t Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st was serving a 35@@ -year sentence after famously lea@@ king classified diplomatic c@@ ables through the web@@ site Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
The new exhi@@ bi@@ tion , which opened on 2 August , is ti@@ tled A Bec@@ oming Res@@ emb@@ lance .
It &apos;s the product of two years of cor@@ respond@@ ence between De@@ we@@ y-@@ H@@ ag@@ bor@@ g , whose discipline combines her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Man@@ ning , a tr@@ ans woman and pione@@ ering dis@@ sident whose sentence was comm@@ u@@ ted by Barack Obama when he had just three days left in office .
By algorith@@ m@@ ically analy@@ zing DNA ex@@ tracted from Man@@ ning and using it to create 30 portra@@ its of what someone with that genom@@ ic data might look like , De@@ we@@ y-@@ H@@ ag@@ bor@@ g has created a tren@@ ch@@ ant , if somewhat ce@@ reb@@ ral , commentary on not only the m@@ alle@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted , and the inherent determin@@ ism of those interpre@@ tations - but also identity .
Man@@ ning , who was born Bra@@ d@@ ley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman as early as adolesc@@ ence , was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges , including six E@@ spi@@ on@@ age Act violations , computer fraud and the@@ ft .
From prison , her image was repres@@ sed , so much so that there was just one pho@@ to - a gran@@ ular , black@@ -and-@@ white sel@@ fi@@ e in which Man@@ ning , vi@@ sibly un@@ easy , s@@ its in a driver &apos;s seat wearing a plat@@ in@@ um bl@@ on@@ de wi@@ g - with which she became associated .
In 2015 , De@@ we@@ y-@@ H@@ ag@@ bor@@ g was coming off the massive success of her 2012 project , S@@ tran@@ ger Vi@@ sions .
In it , the arti@@ st produced portra@@ its of strang@@ ers from fo@@ ren@@ sic arti@@ facts like cigare@@ t@@ te but@@ ts and che@@ wing gu@@ m , ex@@ trac@@ ting DNA from the de@@ tr@@ it@@ us to con@@ j@@ ure an image of what these fol@@ ks might look like .
That was when she received an em@@ ail from P@@ aper Mag@@ az@@ ine .
&quot; They were conducting an interview with Ch@@ el@@ sea Man@@ ning while she was in prison and they wanted some kind of portra@@ it to ac@@ company that article , &quot; De@@ we@@ y-@@ H@@ ag@@ bor@@ g explained at a press pre@@ view of the new exhi@@ bi@@ tion .
And she couldn &apos;t be visited and she couldn &apos;t be photo@@ graph@@ ed at that time , so they reached out to Ch@@ el@@ sea and asked if she &apos;@@ d be interested in having a DNA portra@@ it made .
The arti@@ st and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use became unlikely p@@ en p@@ als , ex@@ changing several let@@ ters over the course of two years .
They even created a com@@ ic book , Sup@@ pressed Im@@ ages , illustr@@ ated by Sho@@ il@@ i K@@ an@@ un@@ go , that envi@@ sioned a future where the president would comm@@ ute Ch@@ el@@ sea &apos;s sentence and she &apos;@@ d be able to see the exhi@@ bi@@ tion in person .
That Obama would indeed call for Man@@ ning &apos;s release just days after the book went public was a welcome sort of se@@ ren@@ di@@ p@@ ity after seven brutal years at a military prison in K@@ an@@ s@@ as .
There &apos;s also something profound and powerful about the exhi@@ bi@@ tion opening now , as Donald Trump wages war on government le@@ akers and trans@@ gender troops while finding new , t@@ wee@@ table ways to further infl@@ ame the stark divisions he &apos;s been called on to m@@ end .
When asked about the peculiar timing of it all , De@@ we@@ y-@@ H@@ ag@@ bor@@ g said that &quot; things happen for a reason . &quot;
In an arti@@ st statement written on the g@@ all@@ ery &apos;s wall , Man@@ ning &apos;s super-@@ sized sign@@ ature below it ( the &quot; i &quot; in her last name do@@ tted with a heart ) , called for an end to the &quot; automatic fac@@ tionalism that gender , race , sexuality , and culture have been the basis of . &quot;
On the opposite wall is her mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a c@@ enti@@ pe@@ de of Cs and G@@ s and As , written in pen@@ cil .
By including the 200 let@@ ters ( or nuc@@ le@@ o@@ ti@@ des , per the arti@@ st &apos;s sophisticated scientific lex@@ ic@@ on ) , De@@ we@@ y-@@ H@@ ag@@ bor@@ g hoped to illustr@@ ate how ast@@ ound@@ ingly similar , at least in biological make@@ up , we all are .
&quot; What I &apos;@@ m hoping that people will take away from this is that our genome doesn &apos;t care about who we are , and how open genetic data is to interpretation , how subj@@ ective it is , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y-@@ H@@ ag@@ bor@@ g , whose 2007 video work , S@@ pu@@ ri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also on display .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so this is 30 of those stories . &quot;
The final piece in the exhi@@ bi@@ tion , which is contained in a single room , is one page from the af@@ ore@@ mentioned graphic no@@ v@@ ell@@ a .
It shows Man@@ ning , emerging , King K@@ ong-@@ es@@ que , from the United States Di@@ si@@ pl@@ inary Bar@@ rac@@ ks with a spe@@ ak@@ er@@ phone in hand .
&quot; When they ch@@ ill your speech , then they &apos;@@ ve won , &quot; it reads .
&quot; So never shut up . &quot;
&quot; It came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; the arti@@ st , who ha@@ ils from Ph@@ il@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a , said .
&quot; I get go@@ ose@@ bu@@ mps still talking about it . &quot;
Man@@ ning hasn &apos;t seen the exhi@@ bi@@ tion in-@@ person yet - as was so pres@@ ci@@ ently imagined in the com@@ ic book - but when she does , she &apos;@@ ll be gre@@ eted in the center of the room by the mas@@ ks , her own genom@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ra cong@@ reg@@ ated like hor@@ des of protesters .
That was pur@@ pose@@ ful , too , as is everything in the exhi@@ bi@@ tion , down to the height ( 5 &quot; 2 , Man@@ ning &apos;s stature ) at which her genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written in pen@@ cil .
&quot; In the past , I &apos;@@ ve had them on the wall but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; De@@ we@@ y-@@ H@@ ag@@ bor@@ g said of the portra@@ its .
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with Ch@@ el@@ sea , like the movement that was behind free@@ ing her as well . &quot;
Nor@@ th@@ western Pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or and Oxford University Emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ e W@@ an@@ ted for Hom@@ ic@@ ide
A nationwide man@@ hun@@ t is underway for a Nor@@ th@@ western University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was found fat@@ ally st@@ ab@@ bed inside a luxury Chicago apar@@ tment , police said .
On Mon@@ day , first-@@ degree murder war@@ rants without bail were issued for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them , 42 , and Andrew Warren , 56 , for their alleged involvement in the death of T@@ ren@@ ton H@@ . James Cor@@ ne@@ l@@ l-@@ D@@ ur@@ an@@ lea@@ u , Co@@ ok Coun@@ ty court records show .
The documents say Cor@@ ne@@ l@@ l-@@ D@@ ur@@ an@@ lea@@ u , 26 , died after being st@@ ab@@ bed multiple times .
A community al@@ ert released by the Chicago Poli@@ ce Department says the body was discovered on July 27 .
O@@ ffic@@ ers received a call and arrived at the Grand Pla@@ za A@@ par@@ tments and found the victim with several lac@@ er@@ ations on his body .
Cor@@ ne@@ l@@ l-@@ D@@ ur@@ an@@ lea@@ u was pronounced dead on the scene and detec@@ tives are investig@@ ating the st@@ ab@@ bing as a hom@@ ic@@ ide while police actively search for the two suspects , officials said .
La@@ them has been an associ@@ ate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K@@ . Cu@@ b@@ b@@ age , the vice president for university relations , said in an em@@ ailed statement that La@@ them is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering Nor@@ th@@ western University camp@@ uses .
&quot; This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the appropriate authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University is co@@ operating in that investigation , &quot; Cu@@ b@@ b@@ age said .
Warren is a senior treasury assist@@ ant at Oxford University .
A spokes@@ person for the university and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an em@@ ailed statement that , &quot; We have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investig@@ ating authorities in any way they need . &quot;
The statement added that Warren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to turn himself in .
Chief Commun@@ ic@@ ations O@@ ffic@@ er of the Chicago Poli@@ ce Department An@@ th@@ ony G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said he strongly encourages the suspects to surrender to authorities .
&quot; Poli@@ ce have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs but our efforts to locate that are intensifying , &quot; G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said .
G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities are helping find the suspects .
G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said police received a call from the Grand Pla@@ za building manag@@ er who had just received a cr@@ yp@@ tic tip that said something had occurred in apar@@ tment 100@@ 8 .
Poli@@ ce described the scene as very g@@ ru@@ es@@ ome .
G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said it is unclear if the incident also occurred on July 27 .
La@@ them and Warren were confirmed to be at the building by security cam@@ er@@ as , he said .
&quot; We believe Pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said .
The management team at Grand Pla@@ za released a statement to residents saying , &quot; Poli@@ ce are currently working on the tim@@ el@@ ine and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; We &apos;@@ ll complete W@@ AD@@ A road@@ map in near future &quot; - Russian Deputy P@@ M M@@ ut@@ ko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister V@@ it@@ al@@ y M@@ ut@@ ko has said it will not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-@@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) criteria for the rein@@ statement of the Russian Anti-@@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ AD@@ A ) .
&quot; A certain stage of fulfilling the road map criteria has been carried out , R@@ US@@ AD@@ A obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ A@@ D ( UK Anti-@@ D@@ oping ) .
The W@@ AD@@ A road@@ map was up@@ dated in this regard , &quot; M@@ ut@@ ko stated on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day .
The P@@ M was comm@@ enting on the second part of W@@ AD@@ A &apos;s Ro@@ ad@@ map to Co@@ de Comp@@ li@@ ance , which describes the criteria for the rein@@ statement of R@@ US@@ AD@@ A and which recently published on the organization &apos;s web@@ site .
According to M@@ ut@@ ko , it does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; Everything has been announced , everything will be implemented .
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee &#91; I@@ O@@ C &#93; and W@@ AD@@ A in the near future , &quot; he added .
One of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that Russian anti-@@ d@@ oping authorities must public@@ ally accept the reported outcomes of the W@@ AD@@ A@@ -@@ sanc@@ tioned investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on alleged state-@@ sponsored d@@ oping in Russian sport .
Ref@@ erring to the matter , M@@ ut@@ ko said : &quot; We are conducting the investigation , as our anti-@@ d@@ oping system admitted a failure .
All measures have been implemented .
But there were no state programs , and we will not admit something that didn &apos;t exist . &quot;
M@@ ut@@ ko &apos;s words echo@@ ed those of V@@ it@@ al@@ y S@@ mir@@ no@@ v , the head of Russia &apos;s In@@ dependent Public Anti-@@ D@@ oping Commission .
Tal@@ king to Russian out@@ let R@@ S@@ port earlier in the day , S@@ mir@@ no@@ v admitted past problems in Russian anti-@@ d@@ oping bodies , but added : &quot; We have said on numerous occasions , that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
No one plans to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; S@@ mir@@ no@@ v added .
R@@ US@@ AD@@ A was suspended from carrying out d@@ oping controls within Russia by W@@ AD@@ A in November 2015 in the wake of the d@@ oping scandal .
It was , however , permitted to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-@@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ A@@ D ) this June .
Following a visit to the organization &apos;s headquarters in Moscow in July , W@@ AD@@ A Director General O@@ li@@ vi@@ er Nig@@ gl@@ i stated that R@@ US@@ AD@@ A is &quot; moving in the right direction &quot; to be rein@@ stated .
As far as computers are concerned , whether Chinese chec@@ kers or chess , defeating humans was already a clin@@ ch decades ago .
The president of Cro@@ atian Foot@@ ball Association D@@ av@@ ao Su@@ k said in an interview that participation in the China Cup is very meaningful for Cro@@ atian football , and the Chinese Cup ’ s bon@@ us was considerable .
For@@ get purchasing agents ! These 8@@ 000@@ -@@ plus products enjoy zero tariff
At the regular press conference of the Ministry of Commer@@ ce ( MO@@ F@@ CO@@ M ) held on January 11@@ th , spokes@@ person G@@ ao F@@ en@@ g said that to date , China has 15 Free Trade Agre@@ ements ( FT@@ As ) in force , involving 23 countries and regions , encompas@@ sing more than 800@@ 0 imported products at zero tariff .
Meanwhile , you no longer have to spend a lot of money to have purchasing agents buy the products you want such as imported co@@ s@@ me@@ tics , sal@@ m@@ on from Iceland , red w@@ ine from Chile , tropical fruits from ASEAN ..@@ .@@ .
Currently , China has signed 16 FT@@ As , involving 24 countries and regions , of which 15 have come into effect , encompas@@ sing more than 800@@ 0 imported products at zero tariff .
T@@ ake agricultural produce for example . The implementation of the FT@@ As has meant that consumers can now sample affordable agricultural produce from different places of production throughout the year .
For instance , import tariffs have been cut to zero for the following products : tropical fruits from ASEAN such as du@@ ri@@ ans , ly@@ che@@ es , and pit@@ aya from 15-@@ 30 % previously ;
sal@@ m@@ on from Iceland , from 10@@ - 12 % ; and
red w@@ ine from Georgia and Chile , from 14@@ -@@ 30 % .
Speci@@ alty agricultural products such as beef and mil@@ k pow@@ der from New Zealand have also seen a relatively large reduction in tariffs .
Industrial products have benefited as well . For example , import tariffs for some co@@ s@@ me@@ tics from Switzerland have been reduced to zero , while
that for some wat@@ ches have fallen to 50 % , and will fall further to zero in a few years ’ time ;
products from South Korea such as ref@@ rig@@ er@@ ators , rice co@@ o@@ kers , mas@@ s@@ age devices , and co@@ s@@ me@@ tic apparatus will now be subject to a lower import tariff of 40 % , and fall further to zero in a few years ’ time ;
and consumer electron@@ ics and other relevant products have also seen a relatively large reduction in tariffs .
Produc@@ ts at zero tariff under the FT@@ As also include intermedi@@ ates and raw materials required for the domestic production of end@@ -@@ user consumer goods , which will , to a certain extent , also upgrade the mix of domestically produced consumer goods .
MO@@ F@@ CO@@ M spokes@@ person G@@ ao F@@ en@@ g said that approximately one-third of China ’ s total imported products enjoy tariff concessions under the FT@@ As , of which the majority are end@@ -@@ user consumer goods , thus providing tangible benefits to consumers .
Further reductions in import tariffs of consumer goods
On December 1 , 2017 , China further lowered the import tariffs of some consumer goods . The reductions covered 18@@ 7 eigh@@ t-@@ digit H@@ S codes comprising food , health supp@@ lements , pharmaceu@@ ticals , chemical products for daily use , clothing , foot@@ wear and head@@ ge@@ ar , home appli@@ ances , culture and rec@@ re@@ ation , mis@@ cel@@ lan@@ eous and sun@@ dry goods , as well as other consumer goods .
The average tariff rate of these consumer goods more than hal@@ ved , plun@@ ging from 17@@ .@@ 3 % to 7.@@ 7 % !
With effect from January 1 , 2018 , partial adjustments were also made to other import and export tariffs .
The import tariffs of li@@ p@@ stick , eye shadow , per@@ fu@@ me and some other co@@ s@@ me@@ tics fell from 10 % to 5 % .
This decline in tariff rates means that consumers do not have to have a purchasing agent or travel overseas to buy the foreign products they like .

Foreign press : Y@@ ear@@ -@@ end return policies at US m@@ alls vary widely ; be cautious when returning gi@@ fts
China News Service , December 29
US-@@ based “ World Journal ” reported that there was a wave of gift returns just after Christmas .
A report by American Bro@@ ad@@ casting Comp@@ any ( A@@ BC ) revealed that approximately half of the goods sold last Christmas were ex@@ changed or returned .
Elsewhere , readers had repeatedly reported having been che@@ ated while shopping online . Sh@@ op@@ p@@ ers should be on their guard when shopping at un@@ official web@@ sites .
In general , large shopping companies have official and reasonable return procedures , but if you have sh@@ op@@ ped for gi@@ fts at certain small stores or online , you must be careful .
A Mad@@ ame H@@ ou of R@@ ow@@ land He@@ ights bought a jac@@ ket from an online store speci@@ alizing in print jac@@ kets for more than $ 60 ( US@@ D , the same he@@ rein@@ after ) on December 1 , local time , but has yet to receive her purchase .
She sent an em@@ ail to customer service but did not receive any re@@ ply from the store .
Elsewhere , a ne@@ tiz@@ en revealed that when on tour in the US last year , he bought a mobile phone from a third-@@ party sel@@ ler , but received a box of plas@@ tic@@ ine on delivery instead .
After he realized he was dec@@ ei@@ ved , he applied for a re@@ fund from the web@@ site . Fortunately , he was able to receive a full re@@ fund .
Nonetheless , some customers felt that web@@ site re@@ fund services are not perfect .
M@@ r W@@ ang , an ethnic Chinese re@@ sident of Northern California , purchased goods at a certain web@@ site on urgent delivery services twice at a cost of $ 4 each but both times , the goods failed to arrive promptly .
He applied for a re@@ fund subsequently but did not get a re@@ ply .
Large department stores or shopping m@@ alls have better return policies .
Most of M@@ acy ’ s merchan@@ di@@ se may be returned for a full re@@ fund within 180 days ,
but the merchan@@ di@@ se has to be in its “ original ” state , and the customer has to produce proof of purchase such as the recei@@ pt or the bank purchase record .
Without proof of purchase , the customer may also receive the store ’ s credit which may be used to purchase other merchan@@ di@@ se .
Tar@@ get has a 9@@ 0-@@ day return deadline for general merchan@@ di@@ se . For electronic products , the deadline is normally 15 days ,
but it is extended to 30 days for electronic and entertainment related products purchased between November 1 and December 25 , 2017 ;
note that the 30-@@ day return deadline begins on December 25 , i.e. , merchan@@ di@@ se purchased must be returned by January 25 , 2018 .
The ultimate shopping experience with the advent of a new era in commercial district shopping development
More than 10 years ago , China was , on the whole , still a sellers ’ market . S@@ election was limited , and so was demand .
A decade hence , the market has long developed into a buyers ’ rather than that of a sellers ’ market . Sh@@ op@@ p@@ ers have now become a lot more demanding as well , and are no longer satisfied simply with a “ cash on delivery of goods ” shopping behavior .
Therefore , how to offer sh@@ op@@ p@@ ers the ultimate shopping experience has become the next competitive point for real estate developers .
Of the many factors that affect a sh@@ op@@ per ’ s shopping experience , the impact of shopping centers in business districts is the most important .
Let ’ s take a look at how urban buil@@ ders focus on the shopping experience .
No two leaves are alike , nor can one find two completely identical shopping m@@ alls . A famous shopping m@@ all must have its own characteristics .
T@@ ake Turkey ’ s world-@@ re@@ now@@ ned K@@ any@@ on Sh@@ opping Center . Its unique und@@ ul@@ ating archit@@ ec@@ tural design was inspired by the Grand C@@ any@@ on , hence its hom@@ oph@@ on@@ ous name K@@ any@@ on . You feel like you ’ re in the Grand C@@ any@@ on when walking along the 200@@ -@@ me@@ ter foot@@ path in the mid@@ section of K@@ any@@ on .
In addition to the can@@ y@@ on-@@ like design , there is a large unique inward con@@ ca@@ ve o@@ val@@ -@@ shaped performance ven@@ ue in the middle of shopping center where speci@@ alty perfor@@ man@@ ces are often held .
Its open platform design offers visit@@ ors at every floor a view of the activities held in the “ can@@ y@@ on ” , and the scene changes as you take each step .
In China , the N@@ anj@@ ing Fore@@ st M@@ all Commer@@ cial Street , known as the country ’ s first forest style pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an consumption ven@@ ue , is a perfect integration of shopping and eco@@ logy as well as fair@@ y tal@@ es .
With a 7@@ ,000 s@@ q@@ m green pla@@ za , and a 3,000 s@@ q@@ m ro@@ of@@ top water feature , the project is made up of nine individual buildings , linked by a sky bridge . The sun@@ ken gar@@ den design for the entire project , plane trees as its archit@@ ec@@ tural surface , and the ro@@ of@@ top water feature create the feeling of being in a forest .
On entering the Fore@@ st M@@ all , you ’ d feel like you have accid@@ entally fallen down the ra@@ b@@ bit hole in Ali@@ ce ’ s Ad@@ ventures In W@@ on@@ der@@ land . The t@@ all tre@@ e tr@@ un@@ ks sur@@ round the buildings , and the law@@ n and stream are beau@@ ti@@ fully ju@@ x@@ ta@@ posed , drawing the masses into a forest full of life and vit@@ ality .
Then there is Ch@@ on@@ q@@ ing . The Li@@ j@@ ia W@@ ater@@ front Business Dist@@ ric@@ t built by Lon@@ gh@@ u Pro@@ per@@ ties has plans to attract a diverse range of businesses , and expects to bring in more than 50 world class flag@@ ship stores , with more than 100 world class bran@@ ds and over 500 re@@ now@@ ned foreign and domestic bran@@ ds so as to create a commercial center with a distinc@@ tive theme that brings the services sector together .
In addition , the Li@@ j@@ ia W@@ ater@@ front Business Dist@@ ric@@ t will also integrate eco@@ logy into architecture . Based on a trans@@ it-@@ oriented development ( TO@@ D ) concept , it integ@@ rates shopping , household services and am@@ en@@ ities , din@@ ing , entertainment , education and sports , providing sh@@ op@@ p@@ ers the ultimate shopping experience while affor@@ ding them the luxury of enjoying Ch@@ ong@@ q@@ ing ’ s unique “ water@@ front culture ” , a perfect bl@@ end of shopping , and water entertainment and rec@@ re@@ ation .
From the above examples , it is noted that , at present , a number of real estate developers have noticed the discovery of this new urban business phenomenon . In@@ siders indicate that this consumption model which is centered on the consumer experience and which explo@@ res the means to combine shopping and experience will become the mainstream of urban development in the future .
Today ’ s business districts are no longer merely the distribution centers of goods . Rather , they are more integrated ven@@ ues that bring together the arts and culture as well as creative them@@ es ; they also carry the responsibility of the masses toward urban living .
Therefore , in addition to meeting the one-@@ stop material needs of din@@ ing and entertainment of consumers , maximizing the transmission of multi-@@ ti@@ ered cultural and arti@@ stic spiritual needs , as well as bringing the li@@ vable qualities of residential needs into play will inevitably become the high point of future business district development .
In Ch@@ ong@@ q@@ ing , Gu@@ ox@@ ing Pro@@ per@@ ty ’ s B@@ ei@@ an@@ ji@@ ang@@ sh@@ an is located north of the Y@@ ang@@ t@@ ze River , close to Gu@@ any@@ in Bri@@ dge , where the who ’ s who of world business and international giants agg@@ l@@ omer@@ ate , and first class bran@@ ds cong@@ reg@@ ate , affor@@ ding a se@@ am@@ less connection with international fashion .
Here , prosperity ab@@ ounds , and the best in the world agg@@ l@@ omer@@ ate .
D@@ ong@@ y@@ u@@ anj@@ in@@ y@@ ue , which is in the immediate vic@@ in@@ ity of N@@ an@@ ping Business Dist@@ ric@@ t , has a better shopping environment . At its sole disposal is Western China ’ s , and indeed , the nation ’ s leading four-@@ story three-@@ dimen@@ sional transportation system , enhancing shopping comfort .
Elsewhere , the land@@ scap@@ ed gar@@ dens and shops along the two pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an streets at Hu@@ ig@@ ong Road and W@@ anda Pla@@ za have been upgra@@ ded , with approximately 300 trees plan@@ ted , and 40@@ ,000 s@@ q@@ m of floor space rev@@ amp@@ ed , lifting the image of N@@ an@@ ping Business Dist@@ ric@@ t .
Meanwhile , Lon@@ gh@@ u ’ s W@@ ater@@ front City , in the immediate vic@@ in@@ ity of Ch@@ ong@@ q@@ ing ’ s first low-@@ den@@ sity water@@ front business district - Li@@ j@@ ia W@@ ater@@ front Business Dist@@ ric@@ t - is surrounded by nine par@@ ks . The commercial street district is low den@@ sity with good access . These qualities have made sh@@ op@@ p@@ ers more willing to stay , stop and slowing sav@@ or the jo@@ y of shopping when shopping , rather than being jo@@ st@@ led by crowds of sh@@ op@@ p@@ ers into ru@@ shing forward . Here , “ shopping at a le@@ i@@ surely pace ” is truly achieved .
Com@@ petition will only intensify going forward . In a market of rampant homo@@ gen@@ ization , how to achieve success , and at@@ tain a reputation as a “ shopping m@@ ec@@ ca ” in the hearts of future sh@@ op@@ p@@ ers deserve serious consideration among all real estate developers .
A differenti@@ ation strategy alone is far from sufficient . Only developers that truly place sh@@ op@@ p@@ ers in their hearts , em@@ path@@ ize with sh@@ op@@ p@@ ers , and offer sh@@ op@@ p@@ ers an ultimate yet simple shopping experience will be able to stand t@@ all in a market when assa@@ iled by intense competition .
To be sure , I believe that , at the end of the day , Ch@@ ong@@ q@@ ing ’ s residents are the happ@@ iest lot to have such excellent shopping experience and business districts . A decade ago , no one would have imagined today ’ s prosperity .
Sh@@ opping car@@ ni@@ val : Con@@ sumer@@ ism rev@@ el@@ ry mas@@ ks true environmental cost
RM@@ B@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 2 billion . That was the amount of money T@@ m@@ all users spent over a 24@@ -@@ hour period on November 11 , 2017 at the “ T@@ m@@ all 11@@ .@@ 11 Global Sh@@ opping F@@ es@@ tiv@@ al ” .
Specifically , in the span of three minutes right after the “ Dou@@ ble 11 ” comm@@ enced , T@@ m@@ all ’ s transaction volume surpassed RM@@ B@@ 10 billion , and exceeded RM@@ B@@ 20 billion in six minutes and five secon@@ ds ; within nine hours , it broke through the RM@@ B@@ 100 billion mark .
That day , sh@@ op@@ p@@ ers all over the world made a total of 1.@@ 48 billion payments by way of Ali@@ pay , an increase of 41 % year-@@ on-@@ year .
Such spending resulted in 8@@ 12 million logistics orders .
Whether the T@@ m@@ all shopping platform or the Ali@@ pay payment platform , however , both be@@ longed to J@@ ack M@@ a ’ s Alibaba Group .
Ten years ago , no one would have imagined that the “ Sing@@ les ’ Day ” sub@@ culture which was a self-@@ de@@ prec@@ ating celebration created by sing@@ les on November 11 would be co-@@ opted by e-@@ commerce merchan@@ ts , and turned into a phenomen@@ al “ Sing@@ les ’ Day ” shopping car@@ ni@@ val today .
Alibaba used the “ Great Sing@@ les ’ Day S@@ ale ” marketing g@@ imm@@ ick : Not dating ? Sing@@ les , come shop online - for the first time on November 11 , 2009 .
The outcome was a surprise . That day , transactions at Ta@@ ob@@ ao M@@ all ( the predecessor of “ T@@ m@@ all ” ) surpassed RM@@ B@@ 52 million , 10 times that of the normal daily transaction value at the time .
From then on , “ Dou@@ ble 11 ” has become a shopping fes@@ tiv@@ al created by Alibaba , and has grown and expanded from a domestic bu@@ y@@ er-@@ sel@@ ler am@@ us@@ ement to an inf@@ low of global merchan@@ ts . N@@ ine years hence , and the more than RM@@ B@@ 100 billion worth of transactions of T@@ m@@ all ’ s “ Dou@@ ble 11 ” is now more than 3@@ 200 times that of the first year , far out@@ stri@@ pping that of “ Black Fri@@ day ” .
Nu@@ mer@@ ous e-@@ commerce merchan@@ ts have followed T@@ m@@ all ’ s “ Dou@@ ble 11 ” sales promotion , with “ J@@ D@@ .@@ com ” the strongest competi@@ tor .
“ J@@ D@@ .@@ com ” has its own shopping fes@@ tiv@@ al “ 6.@@ 18 ” but its impact is less than that of “ Dou@@ ble 11 ” . From November 1 to 11 this year , “ J@@ D@@ .@@ com ” ’ s accumulated sales amounted to RM@@ B@@ 12@@ 7.@@ 1 billion .
The “ Dou@@ ble 12 ” discount extra@@ vag@@ an@@ za and the Christ@@ mas@@ -@@ New Year shopping period come right after “ Dou@@ ble 11 ” .
Following the New Year , pre-@@ Spring F@@ es@@ tiv@@ al ’ s L@@ un@@ ar New Year shopping as well as Val@@ ent@@ ine &apos;s Day shopping awa@@ it the Chinese consumer . Re@@ tail consumption knows no holiday .
Mas@@ sive in@@ stan@@ taneous consumption has led to environmental problems , which has attracted the attention of professionals and institutions .
A Xin@@ hu@@ a D@@ aily Te@@ le@@ gra@@ ph report revealed that based on the industry ’ s general standard conservative estimate of 0.2 k@@ g per pack@@ aging car@@ tons , at least 300,000 ton@@ nes of tra@@ sh were generated during this year ’ s “ Sing@@ les ’ Day ” period .
Liu Hu@@ a , Director of the Pol@@ lu@@ tion Pre@@ vention Program at Green@@ peace East Asia told ch@@ in@@ adi@@ alogue that the volume of orders at this year ’ s “ Sing@@ les ’ Day ” from T@@ m@@ all alone would generate 160@@ ,000 ton@@ nes of pack@@ aging tra@@ sh .
In 2016 , the State Post Bu@@ reau published a report stating that approximately 7@@ 80 million items were delivered by express cou@@ ri@@ ers during the 2015 “ Sing@@ les ’ Day ” period ( November 11@@ -@@ 16 ) , with more than 3 billion wo@@ ven bag@@ s , 9.@@ 9@@ 22 billion pack@@ aging car@@ tons , and 16@@ .@@ 9@@ 85 billion meters of adhe@@ sive tape used . The length of adhe@@ sive tape used could go round the equ@@ ator 4@@ 25 times .
This year , the State Post Bu@@ reau estimates that the “ Sing@@ les ’ Day ” express business volume could surpass 1.5 billion items .
W@@ ang Shi , manag@@ er of a waste inc@@ in@@ eration plant in Beijing told Xin@@ hu@@ a News Agency that more than 2,000 ton@@ nes of tra@@ sh enter the plant each day after “ Sing@@ les ’ Day ” , exceeding the treatment capacity of the inc@@ in@@ eration plant .
Ex@@ press delivery companies have also become aware that the environmental pollution resulting from the express delivery sector should not be ignored .
Some e-@@ commerce logistics enterprises , including Sun@@ ing , have introduced plastic express delivery bo@@ xes that may be recyc@@ led and re@@ used ahead of “ Sing@@ les ’ Day ” , as well as rec@@ y@@ cl@@ able pack@@ aging such as shopping bag@@ s and tra@@ sh bag@@ s that may be used repeatedly . However , acceptance among consumers who could not be bo@@ thered was low .
J@@ ack M@@ a , on W@@ ei@@ bo , has also called on the logistics industry to support “ green pack@@ aging ” and “ green logistics ” .
This W@@ ei@@ bo received more than 6@@ 8@@ ,000 “ likes ” .
What sort of mobile payment do Germans want ?
Z@@ hang D@@ ong@@ f@@ ang : The mobile payment war w@@ aged in Germany is nothing new .
All We@@ Ch@@ at P@@ ay and Ali@@ pay did was to move the battle@@ ground to Europe . Neither the competitors nor the battle@@ ground has changed - the Chinese ; is this really globalization ?
Where there ’ s Ali@@ pay , there ’ s We@@ Ch@@ at P@@ ay .
According to the agreement with Germany ’ s electronic payment services provider W@@ i@@ rec@@ ard , We@@ Ch@@ at P@@ ay officially entered Germany in November this year . The Chinese company has also gradually expanded its presence among merchan@@ ts in Europe .
This time round , the re@@ union of the two “ fellow country@@ men ” in a foreign country took place in Europe .
All along , Ali@@ pay and We@@ Ch@@ at P@@ ay have been riding high on the road to globalization .
In a study on China ’ s mobile Internet payment ’ s globalization methods , i@@ Research Con@@ sul@@ ting ’ s “ 2017 China &apos;s Thir@@ d-@@ Party M@@ ob@@ ile Pay@@ ment Report ” arrived at two methods : The first method would be by way of strategic investment , outw@@ ard transfer of experience , taking an equity stake , and supporting the overseas local mobile payment enterprise ;
the second method would be by way of promoting mobile payment services to overseas merchan@@ ts through Chinese tourists ’ overseas spending behavior , thereby changing overseas local entities ’ recognition and acceptance of China ’ s mobile payments .
Indeed , win over the Chinese , and you win the world .
China ’ s rapid economic growth coupled with its large population base have meant that spending by Chinese tourists in Europe is an attractive figure ,
but this also means that the mobile payment war w@@ aged in Germany is nothing new .
All We@@ Ch@@ at P@@ ay and Ali@@ pay did was to move the battle@@ ground to Europe . Neither the competitors nor the battle@@ ground has changed - it ’ s still the Chinese ; is this really globalization ?
A more ground@@ breaking inquiry would be whether China ’ s mobile payment can expand its territory in Europe .
Germany is an example .
Mag@@ ical “ new retail ”
Chen Xin@@ le@@ i , Y@@ ang K@@ ai@@ han : When Amazon made it to the world ’ s top 10 list of retail@@ ers , it announced that it would venture into the book@@ stores and gro@@ cer@@ y stores ; this is worth pon@@ dering , both in terms of opportunity and motive .
In November 2015 , Amazon opened its first physical book@@ store in Se@@ attle . This was followed by two book@@ stores in Por@@ t@@ land and San D@@ ie@@ go .
At the beginning of 2017 , Amazon opened its book@@ store and New York , and planned to have at least eight stores by the end of the year .
Almost at the same time , Amazon announced that its chec@@ k@@ out-@@ free gro@@ cer@@ y store Amazon G@@ o would begin trial operations . No waiting in line or chec@@ k@@ out is necessary . All customers have to do is s@@ can their Q@@ R code on the Amazon G@@ o ap@@ p to enter the store , take the products they want and leave . The shopping amount would be charged to the customers ’ Amazon account .
As far as Amazon is concerned , its sudden but frequent for@@ ays into physical stores in the last few years have been very unexpected .
This is because way back in 2007 , CEO J@@ ef@@ f Be@@ z@@ os , in his “ Le@@ t@@ ter to Sha@@ re@@ holders ” , highlighted that Amazon would not arbitr@@ arily start a new business ( such as a physical store ) unless the four conditions set out below are met simultaneously :
1 . We must convince ourselves that the new opportunity can generate the returns on capital our investors expected when they invested in Amazon ;
2@@ . we must convince ourselves that the new business can grow to a scale where it can be significant in the context of our overall company ;
3@@ . we must believe that the opportunity is currently under@@ served ; and
4@@ . we have the capabilities needed to bring strong custom@@ er-@@ facing differenti@@ ation to the marketplace .
Bo@@ ok@@ stores and gro@@ cer@@ y stores are the two most precarious physical retail sub-@@ sectors , and were the first to be knoc@@ ked out after the rise of Amazon .
When Amazon made it to the world ’ s top 10 list of retail@@ ers , it announced that it would venture into these two physical markets ; this is worth pon@@ dering , both in terms of opportunity and motive .
D@@ id Amazon do something in contrary to the guarantee it made in its letter to shareholders ?
Similar words were echo@@ ed at the other end of the world . On the morning of October 13 , 2016 , at The Com@@ pu@@ ting Conference 2016 held in Yun@@ q@@ i , H@@ ang@@ zhou , Alibaba Chairman J@@ ack M@@ a said in his ke@@ y@@ note address that ,
“ From next year on@@ ward , Alibaba will no longer talk about ‘ e-@@ commerce ’ .
The era of pure e-@@ commerce firms will soon come to an end . E@@ -@@ commerce will no longer exist in the next 10 to 20 years , replaced instead by ‘ new retail ’ .
Only by combining online and off@@ line operations will new retail come into being . ”
In an instant , it was as if the words “ new retail ” took on mag@@ ical properties , and became the new catch@@ phrase of industry in@@ siders .
So what is “ new retail ” exactly ?
If it merely referred to on@@ lin@@ e-@@ off@@ line integration , then the concept is nothing new .
In 2016 , e@@ Mar@@ ke@@ ter , after tracking 180 of the largest e-@@ commerce firms , estimated that total sales of e-@@ commerce firms amounted to approximately US $ 200 billion , of which the largest 25 accounted for more than US $ 15@@ 9 billion ;
and of these 25 , 18 were traditional retail@@ ers that had only begun online operations in the preceding five years ( such as M@@ acy ’ s , Nor@@ d@@ st@@ rom , Tar@@ get and G@@ ap ) .
Indeed , Alibaba Group &apos;s RM@@ B@@ 28@@ .@@ 3 billion acquisition of an equity stake in Sun@@ ing Commer@@ ce Group was still fresh in the minds of the public .
From a global perspective , both retail@@ ers and e-@@ commerce firms are transforming from a single channel to a multi-@@ channel retail system that encompas@@ ses physical stores , e-@@ commerce , mobile termin@@ als and social media .
Could J@@ ack M@@ a ’ s “ new retail ” be more of a conclusion rather than a forecast for the future ?
If not , then what is the difference between the multi-@@ channel concept and “ new retail ” ?
Perhaps , the cru@@ x of the matter is not whether online and off@@ line entities would integrate , but how .
A review of the retail sector in the last 20 years has revealed that the rise of e-@@ commerce was similar to the emergence of discount retail@@ ers many years ago ; both were focused on price and convenience .
On the basis of these two trigger points , e-@@ commerce firms moved highly standar@@ di@@ zed products , such as books and CD@@ s , online from off@@ line .
As online retail habits formed , and customer experience continued to rise , e-@@ commerce firms further extended their scope to other product categories , and began to increase efficiency .
In Ali@@ ab@@ aba CEO Daniel Z@@ hang ’ s words , “ U@@ se the thinking behind and technology of the Internet to thoroughly reform and upgrade the approximately 30 trillion retail@@ ers in society at this time , so that the increasingly demanding retail requirements of Chinese consumers may be effectively met . This will make the entire goods production , circulation and services process more efficient with the extensive application of the Internet and big data . ”
Thus , the path of e-@@ commerce firms is asset-@@ light on the surface , but asset-@@ heavy in reality .
“ L@@ ight ” ref@@ ers to fixed assets , head@@ count , management processes and other burdens that are less than that of traditional retail@@ ers ; “ heavy ” ref@@ ers to areas such as logistics and storage that require enormous investment .
Chang@@ es in logis@@ tical methods ensured the efficiency of e-@@ commerce firms .
The Chinese Central Government ’ s official web port@@ al reported that Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang pre@@ sided over the State Council executive meeting held on April 28 , which was of the opinion that expanding domestic consumption was a key measure for stable growth and structural transformation .
The meeting determined that relevant departments should promptly put forward specific plans on the basis of scientific evaluation .
The import tariffs of some foreign goods for daily use for which domestic consumers have enormous demand will be lowered on a trial basis with effect from June this year , and tariff reductions will be extended to more goods over time .
Together with the tax reform , consumption tax policies for general consumer goods such as clothing and co@@ s@@ me@@ tics will be optim@@ ized , with overall adjustments made to the scope of taxation , tax rates , and the different parts of the taxation process .
More port of entry du@@ ty-@@ free shops will be set up and restored , and the variety of du@@ ty-@@ free goods will be expanded appropriately , with the value of du@@ ty-@@ free shopping increased by a certain amount so that domestic consumers would find it convenient to purchase foreign products in China .
Sh@@ opping and customs clear@@ ance , as well as tax re@@ fund for foreign tourists would expe@@ d@@ ited , and the requirement for voluntary tax declaration of imported goods shall be strictly implemented according to the law .

On January 18 , Alibaba held an e-@@ commerce poverty eradication summit in Ch@@ ong@@ q@@ ing , and announced that it would explore a new “ Internet + Poverty eradication ” model to help spur measures targeted at eradic@@ ating poverty and revit@@ alize the rural economy .
This follows Alibaba ’ s rural strategy , launch of the R@@ ural Ta@@ ob@@ ao program , online rural revit@@ alization and poverty relief platform , as well as the founding of the Alibaba Poverty Reli@@ ef Fund , and is a ste@@ p@@ -up commitment by Alibaba toward combating poverty .
Com@@ b@@ ating and eradic@@ ating poverty is pres@@ ently one of China ’ s key national strategies .
Com@@ ple@@ te eradication of poverty is unprecedented in the history of China .
“ Poverty relief via e-@@ commerce is a new round of innovative measures aimed at poverty relief and development . It is an important means to achieve measures targeted at poverty relief and eradication .
The Central government very concerned with this issue and has indicated that the Internet can play a part in helping to combat poverty , advance measures targeted at poverty relief and eradication , as well as allow agricultural products to be sold outside the countryside via the Internet . ”
As such , Alibaba had proposed a rural strategy as far back as 2014 , which together with big data cl@@ oud computing and globalization are its three major core strategies for the next 20 years .
In the same year , Alibaba launched the R@@ ural Ta@@ ob@@ ao program , recru@@ iting “ village partners ” to help lift vill@@ agers out of poverty and move toward afflu@@ ence by way of e-@@ commerce .
In 2017 , Alibaba worked together with the Ministry of Commer@@ ce to create a rural revit@@ alization and poverty relief channel that is now connected to a total of 13 provinces and 120 national level pover@@ ty-@@ stric@@ ken coun@@ ties .
The Alibaba platform has inc@@ u@@ b@@ ated 2@@ 11@@ 8 Ta@@ ob@@ ao Vill@@ ages ,
of which close to 400 have emerged in pover@@ ty-@@ stric@@ ken coun@@ ties of various provinces , and 33 in 13 pover@@ ty-@@ stric@@ ken provinces .
In 2017 , at Alibaba ’ s China retail platform , nationwide sales of Ta@@ ob@@ ao Vill@@ ages amounted to RM@@ B@@ 120 billion .
Daniel Z@@ hang said that confronted with the national strategy to combat poverty , Alibaba has been thinking about how it could effectively use the technology , big data , cl@@ oud computing and other innovative compe@@ ten@@ cies within the Alibaba economy to help develop a new path for poverty eradication .
R@@ ural Ta@@ ob@@ ao , in particular , is a major platform to help eradicate poverty via e-@@ commerce , and has opened up a new online direct supply and sales link to help eradicate poverty .
At planting phase , R@@ ural Ta@@ ob@@ ao and An@@ t Financial Services have jointly offered means to acquire agricultural resources and tools as well as obtain micro-@@ loans .
In 2017 , of the 8@@ 32 national-@@ level pover@@ ty-@@ stric@@ ken coun@@ ties , 7@@ 95 were served by An@@ t Financial Services , which provided convenient payments , credit and other relevant services .
C@@ ain@@ ia@@ o helped with w@@ are@@ housing and logistics , while T@@ m@@ all was responsible for selling . Alibaba C@@ l@@ oud ’ s big data provided feedback and guidance on agricultural production , further raising the supply standards , quality and market competitiveness of the agricultural produce .
The growth in poverty eradication via e-@@ commerce not only requires products , sales channels and industry planning , it also requires talent .
By way of the e-@@ commerce courses conducted by Ta@@ ob@@ ao University , Alibaba teach@@ es farmers standar@@ di@@ zed , quality and large-scale methods of cultiv@@ ation , achieving a combination of “ Poverty relief + Know@@ led@@ ge support ” so that poverty eradication among farmers is sustainable .
These courses have already reached approximately 9@@ 2 % of national-@@ level pover@@ ty-@@ stric@@ ken coun@@ ties .
The “ philanthrop@@ ic mentality , commercial means ” poverty eradication thinking can also ensure that Alibaba will “ genuinely perform poverty relief ” when carrying out poverty relief activities .
Alibaba Chairman J@@ ack M@@ a once said that eradic@@ ating poverty should be divided into three pha@@ ses - poverty relief , poverty eradication and becoming affluent .
Poverty relief is to give someone a fish ; poverty eradication is to teach someone to fish ; and becoming affluent is to build a “ fish p@@ ond ” for farmers so that farmers can bre@@ ed fish .
Poverty relief through industry development led by e-@@ commerce is building that fish p@@ ond .
In terms of poverty relief through industry development , Alibaba has par@@ t@@ ne@@ red Lu@@ och@@ uan Coun@@ ty in Sha@@ anx@@ i Prov@@ ince to create a Lu@@ och@@ uan ap@@ ple poverty relief through industry development model , which has been replic@@ ated and promoted nationwide as a model by relevant departments .
Alibaba ’ s poverty relief via e-@@ commerce initiatives have also won the recognition of decision makers .
E@@ -@@ commerce firms , represented by Alibaba , have been given the message that farmers would see an increase in production and income with the help of online and off@@ line channels .
Some village partners and An@@ t Financial staff have also been invited to the United Nations and Africa to share their poverty relief via e-@@ commerce experience .
Currently , the China office of The United Nations World Food Progra@@ m@@ me ( W@@ F@@ P ) has already par@@ t@@ ne@@ red R@@ ural Ta@@ ob@@ ao in implementing a poverty relief through industry development program in An@@ hu@@ i and other areas .
S@@ ina Finance news . The “ 3@@ r@@ d New Economy Think Tan@@ k Summit ” jointly organized by Ali Research Institute and the China Vi@@ sionary Think Tan@@ k Forum was held on January 16 . Z@@ hang Li , deputy director of the e-@@ commerce research department at the Ministry of Commer@@ ce Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation attended and addressed the Summit .
She believed that our globalization had in fact ignored the most fundamental issues , i.e. , those related to the essence and form of globalization , as well as issues associated with pha@@ ses of globalization .
As a result , many believed that globalization has stagn@@ ated . Moreover , in the new phase , many developed and developing countries hold different attitudes toward globalization and its pattern .
The second concept is concerned with issues related to the intermedi@@ ate phase of globalization . What constra@@ ins the intermedi@@ ate phase of globalization ?
The reason why globalization is constrained by the economic environment and fundamentals is precisely because changing economic fundamentals have led to constraints on globalization .
Z@@ hang Li believed that adjustments to the global economy have generally come to an end at the end of 2017 . A new growth phase , will begin in 2018 , and growth will be driven by producer goods .
J@@ D ’ s first fresh food super@@ market 7@@ F@@ R@@ ES@@ H officially opened for business recently , and plans to set up more than 1,000 stores nationwide in three to five years .
Together with Alibaba ’ s H@@ em@@ a Super@@ market , Y@@ on@@ gh@@ u@@ i Super@@ stores ’ Sup@@ er Sp@@ ec@@ ies , Sun@@ ing ’ s S@@ U@@ F@@ R@@ ES@@ H , Me@@ it@@ uan ’ s Z@@ hang@@ y@@ u St@@ ore , and others , “ new retail outlets ” have begun to emerge in clu@@ sters , and have even “ challenged ” each other on price in this innovative model .
The fresh food super@@ market war has escal@@ ated , and have become a phenomen@@ al topic in the new retail sector . Just what is new in new retail ?
“ We will rapidly expand nationwide in 2018 , and will open a large number of stores in Beijing , Shanghai and H@@ ang@@ zhou before the Spring F@@ es@@ tiv@@ al , ”
H@@ em@@ a Super@@ market CEO H@@ ou Y@@ i revealed the company ’ s new approach for 2018 at the 2@@ n@@ d New Re@@ tail Summit on the 10@@ th .
“ With effect from 2018 , H@@ em@@ a will not merely be a fresh produce e-@@ commerce firm ; rather , we will be a general household goods and gro@@ cer@@ y e-@@ commerce firm that meets consumers ’ requirement for promp@@ t delivery service .
The core model calls for conduc@@ tion and experience in off@@ line stores , while genuine sales are done online . ”
Unlike traditional hyper@@ markets and super@@ markets , H@@ em@@ a Super@@ market is , in the eyes of many consumers , a popular Internet store that is fu@@ n and has good food . Some intermedi@@ aries have even come up with the concept of “ He district housing ” ( housing within a 3@@ k@@ m radi@@ us of a H@@ em@@ a Super@@ market ) .
Both online e-@@ commerce platforms and off@@ line retail stores have their respective strengths and weaknesses , and consumers are present at various channels . Therefore , both parties are attempting the multi-@@ channel model .
Indu@@ stry in@@ siders believe that against the general backdrop of consumption upgrading , more “ H@@ em@@ a type ” stores will be opened in 2018 .
Meanwhile , H@@ em@@ a has continued to widen its product scope , expanding from fresh foods initially into other consumer goods . This suggests that more innovation in the retail market will be forthcoming in the new year .
“ For instance , the integrated on@@ lin@@ e-@@ off@@ line business model has attracted consumer e@@ ye@@ b@@ alls . F@@ resh foods super@@ markets that have opened across the country have been popular among and welcomed by the masses . ”
“ Nonetheless , these relationships are useless regardless of how much you talk about them or how cool they are . At the end of the day , it ’ s all about whether or not you have given consumers a good experience . Only after I have had an experience would I be willing to foot the bill . ”
As far as R@@ T@@ -@@ Mar@@ t ’ s fe@@ ini@@ u@@ .@@ com CEO Y@@ uan B@@ in is concerned , under the new retail environment , consumer habits have changed ; and shopping requirements have changed as well .
O@@ rig@@ in@@ ally , there was a clear de@@ mar@@ c@@ ation between online and off@@ line ; off@@ line wanted to defeat online , and online wanted to counter-@@ attack off@@ line . Now , on the other hand , it ’ s become a partnership , because consumers no longer see a difference between online and off@@ line .
Capital , competing for a sli@@ ce of the pie , has made the retail market , represented by fresh food super@@ markets , a pow@@ der ke@@ g .
Analy@@ sis shows that at present , new retail competition in Ti@@ er 1 cities is still a long way from a red ocean situation , and there is still plenty of Ti@@ er 2 cities yet to be explo@@ red . E@@ norm@@ ous opportunities and potential exist in the market .
New retail plans proposed by different types of industries will lead new retail development into a state of diversified growth .
CC@@ T@@ V@@ -2 and the National Academy of Economic Strategy , CA@@ S@@ S have comp@@ iled a st@@ ack of dry goods , i.e. , this weigh@@ ty annual report on the development of the e-@@ commerce industry in China .
What sort of report card did China ’ s e-@@ commerce industry receive this year ?
What are the growth trends of the global e-@@ commerce industry ?
Let us reveal the results one by one .
T@@ ot@@ al sales volume set a new record while growth returned to the acceleration track
China ’ s online retail sales have been sky rocke@@ ting since 2006 . This may be attributed to the fact that online shopping was still a very novel idea at the time . Sh@@ opping without leaving home ; cool !
Since 2013 however , the online retail sales growth rate has deceler@@ ated from more than 50 % to less than 40 % for the first time in 2015 ; in 2016 , the growth rate was 2@@ 6.@@ 2 % .
The situation changed this year , however . On@@ line retail sales accelerated again . For the first nine months of this year , growth rate reb@@ ounded to 3@@ 4.@@ 2 % ,
significantly higher than the growth rates seen in 2015 and 2016 .
Perhaps sh@@ op@@ p@@ ers took a de@@ tour but eventually realized that retail therapy does won@@ ders for one ’ s mind and body .
In particular , online retail sales of physical goods amounted to approximately RM@@ B@@ 5.@@ 0@@ 8 trillion , while online retail sales of services amounted to nearly RM@@ B@@ 1.@@ 49 trillion .
This comp@@ ris@@ ed 13@@ .@@ 6 % of total retail sales of consumer goods , up nearly 3 percentage points year-@@ on-@@ year .
W@@ ake up , students . It ’ s time to highlight the key points . On@@ line retail sales of services was defin@@ itely a major contribu@@ tor !
Elsewhere , per capita online shopping of French ne@@ tiz@@ ens who are obsessed with online shopping amounted to US $ 1,@@ 9@@ 25 . Go@@ ods they purchased online are primarily clothing , worthy of being called a nation of fashion lo@@ vers .
Who says those who love online shopping most must be young ?
The start-@@ ups that will help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
A@@ my Er@@ re@@ tt wanted to gau@@ ge employee happiness at her e-@@ commerce start-@@ up , but surveys we@@ ren &apos;t working .
Respon@@ ses were often vague , un@@ helpful or , worse , dec@@ e@@ it@@ ful .
And even if she promised an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers didn &apos;t trust the process .
&quot; It just never had consistency and obj@@ ec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ re@@ tt , who runs the 7@@ 5-@@ person San Francisco e-@@ commerce ha@@ ir care company Ma@@ dis@@ on Re@@ ed .
So she called in outsiders for help .
A new bre@@ ed of human resources start-@@ ups is cro@@ pping up to help companies figure out how their employees feel .
By building and licen@@ sing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , they allow companies to do sn@@ ap polls , target specific teams and demographic groups , offer employees an@@ onym@@ ity and compla@@ int hot@@ lines , and in some cases allow wh@@ ist@@ le-@@ blow@@ ers to byp@@ ass C@@ -@@ su@@ ite executives and go stra@@ ight to the board of directors .
&quot; You &apos;@@ ve now got tools such as Stra@@ va and F@@ it@@ bit for tracking your health , but where &apos;s the F@@ it@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ net@@ t , co-@@ founder and chief executive of Re@@ d@@ wood City start-@@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ re@@ tt said she gained more insight into what her employees were thinking and feeling in three years using G@@ lin@@ t .
In addition to the sn@@ ap surveys and polls of specific teams , it offers a heat map of the company showing at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval scores - allowing her to dri@@ ll down on why .
Companies are coming to realize they must stay on top of their workplace culture , lest they become the next Uber , which has been en@@ me@@ shed in scandal since a former employee published a blo@@ g post describing an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who spoke out were punished .
For start-@@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this desire for oversight is a lucrative business opportunity .
The global governance , regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $ 1@@ 18@@ .@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to finance tech insights web@@ site Let &apos;s Tal@@ k Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Col@@ o . , start-@@ up Conver@@ cent , which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an up@@ tic@@ k in interest and activity earlier this year amid Uber &apos;s fall into dis@@ repu@@ te .
Conver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft , and T@@ es@@ la .
Uber recently signed up as a cli@@ ent .
Like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent lets companies send custom@@ ized &quot; pul@@ se &quot; surveys , gather confid@@ ential responses in real time , and view heat m@@ aps of its problem areas .
It also offers an an@@ onymous tex@@ ting hot@@ line that lets employees report bad behavior .
And if the chief executive is implic@@ ated , complaints go stra@@ ight to the board of directors .
&quot; The court of public opinion has us@@ ur@@ ped regulators , &quot; said Pat@@ ric@@ k Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and chief executive of Conver@@ cent .
If a company is found to treat its employees poorly or behave un@@ eth@@ ically , even if regulators don &apos;t step in , it can face costly consequences from consumer boycot@@ ts , employee at@@ tri@@ tion and lawsuits , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ day , the restaur@@ ant chain with more than 25@@ ,000 employees across 500 locations , has used Conver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and offer an easy way to reach its corporate headquarters .
Pre@@ viously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or em@@ ail for corporate headquarters , lo@@ dge a formal compla@@ int , and hope it was taken seriously .
It was often an intimid@@ ating and uncomfortable experience , said James V@@ it@@ ran@@ o , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ day &apos;s general coun@@ sel , who said there was no good way of tracking employee complaints .
Now that the company is using Conver@@ cent , though , problems that were previously hidden from executives who sat in offices cities or states away - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair wage practices - can be more quickly identified and addressed .
&quot; I can get closer to that ho@@ listic , 3@@ 60@@ -@@ degree view into the employment experience , &quot; said V@@ it@@ ran@@ o , who over@@ sees Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ day &apos;s risk management group .
&quot; And we &apos;@@ re protecting our shareholders from employment li@@ tig@@ ation . &quot;
Companies started taking ethics , values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Ar@@ th@@ ur An@@ der@@ sen collapsed because of ethical violations from the En@@ ron scandal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
But it wasn &apos;t until &quot; social media came into its own &quot; that companies realized they couldn &apos;t stop their dirty laun@@ dry from going viral online .
&quot; Pri@@ or to using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
Both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer their software as a service , char@@ ging companies recur@@ ring fees to use their products .
It &apos;s a business model and opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors , who have pro@@ pped up both start-@@ ups .
Conver@@ cent raised $ 10 million in funding in February from firms such as S@@ ap@@ ph@@ ire V@@ ent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , bringing its total capital raised to $ 47 million .
G@@ lin@@ t secured $ 10 million in November from B@@ ess@@ em@@ er V@@ ent@@ ure Partn@@ ers , bringing its total funding to $ 60 million .
These investments hardly come as a surprise , given the interconnected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
There &apos;s a growing body of research showing today &apos;s employees expect more from their work@@ places than before .
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are merely table stakes .
Emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es want to feel that they &apos;@@ re accepted and valued and that they &apos;@@ re giving their time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; When people are happy to be at a company , feel their voices are heard , and that the work they are doing is rewarding , they are more committed to making that company successful , &quot; said N@@ ina Mc@@ Qu@@ e@@ en , vice president of global benefits and employee experience at L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ In , which uses both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well ; companies do well when employees are committed and engaged .
If third-@@ party analy@@ tics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement , it &apos;s no wonder they &apos;@@ re finding backing .
Having data on employee engagement is important , according to workplace culture experts .
But the data are useless unless a company &apos;s custo@@ di@@ ans take action .
In fact , if a company asks employees for their feedback , it can set an expectation that change is on the way .
And if change doesn &apos;t come fast enough , or at all , it can bre@@ ed disappointment and make employees dis@@ engaged .
&quot; If you &apos;@@ re going to ask for 4,000 sugg@@ es@@ tions , you need to be prepared to have 4,000 convers@@ ations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , president of consul@@ ting at business management firm K@@ ot@@ ter International , who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection .
&quot; Because if you don &apos;t follow through , employees will wonder , &apos; D@@ id you really hear me ?
Do you care ?
And if you don &apos;t care , why should I care ? &apos; &quot;
Ma@@ dis@@ on Re@@ ed , which now does monthly employee surveys , has been able to take action the same day a problem is reported on G@@ lin@@ t , according to Er@@ re@@ tt .
And , after gathering feedback from employees frustrated by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication , she was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues .
Over at Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ day , the company is getting new insight on its employees , and it &apos;s hoping that in the long run , this will convert to better re@@ tention of workers in an industry known for high tur@@ no@@ ver .
&quot; If you &apos;@@ re not committed to creating a culture of transparency , you &apos;@@ re going to lose people , &quot; V@@ it@@ ran@@ o said .
&quot; And if you lose people , you &apos;@@ re going to lose customers .
And when you lose customers , you &apos;@@ re going to lose companies . &quot;

The trade-@@ off from no two-@@ a-@@ days is more one-@@ a-@@ days , the B@@ ru@@ ins pushing up the start of camp nearly a week from last season and holding practices during summer school for the first time during Mor@@ a &apos;s six seas@@ ons in West@@ wood .
They are scheduled to hold 18 practices through Aug@@ . 20 before beginning formal game prepar@@ ations for their open@@ er against Texas A &amp; M on S@@ ep@@ t .
Mor@@ a said he supported the N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s rule change even if it did add another it@@ em to players &apos; busy it@@ iner@@ aries .
&quot; We &apos;@@ re putting this enormous load on them for three or four days and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; And they &apos;@@ ve just pushed through it ; they gr@@ ind , they &apos;@@ re great kids .
I think once we get to S@@ atur@@ day and we &apos;@@ ll have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
U@@ CL@@ A will close its practices once camp is finished , no easy task given the clear sight lines of its fields from an ad@@ jac@@ ent par@@ king lot and the ad@@ joining L@@ us@@ kin Center , an up@@ scale hotel that has already been pel@@ ted with foot@@ b@@ alls that cle@@ ared a protective net behind a go@@ al@@ post .
B@@ ru@@ ins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel beginning this wee@@ k@@ end , but Mor@@ a acknowledged that there could be an issue once those rooms are vac@@ ant during the season .
&quot; We will have security , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; That is a real concern and it &apos;s not far-@@ fet@@ ched to think that people can rent a room and sit up there and vide@@ ot@@ ap@@ e a practice .
If you have vide@@ ot@@ ap@@ e of a practice , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
But we &apos;@@ ll have security there and we &apos;@@ ll have security up in Par@@ king L@@ ot 8 .
We &apos;@@ ll do the best we can with what we got .
I &apos;@@ m not going to worry too much about it .
We have a plan in place . &quot;
F@@ ig@@ ures from the Australian Bu@@ reau of St@@ atis@@ tics ( A@@ BS ) revealed that in the second quarter of this year , residential property prices in Australia nationwide rose by an average of 1.5 % to 2 % , and were 3.5 % higher on an annual basis , the lowest annual growth rate since March 2013 .
Just when real estate agents were looking forward to selling more real estate during the holiday season , growth rate of residential property prices was the lowest since 2013 .
IT Home reported this morning that Wall Street Journal claimed that AT &amp; T has canceled plans to sell Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i ’ s new flag@@ ship smart phone in the US .
Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i ’ s original plan was to announce this partnership at the CE@@ S this week , but AT &amp; T canceled the partnership at the last minute .
In a January 9 response to a Blo@@ om@@ berg repor@@ ter as regards this turn of events ( January 9 US local time ) , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i said that it would release its new product and specific li@@ sting information to the US market .
Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i indicated that in the past five years , it has already launched high-@@ end products worldwide and in the US market , proving its strength and competence .
According to the earlier IT Home report , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i will un@@ ve@@ il the “ best smar@@ t@@ phone you ’ ve never heard of ” in the after@@ no@@ on of January 9 at the CE@@ S held in L@@ as Ve@@ gas . The bat@@ tery life of this model could support two days of continuous use .

Y@@ est@@ er@@ day , the film held a work@@ shop with the theme “ S@@ orrow in C@@ ome@@ dies ” in Beijing . F@@ en@@ g Xia@@ og@@ ang , N@@ ing Ha@@ o and D@@ a Pen@@ g attended the event .
Alter@@ n@@ ating circul@@ ar and square image composition ; the director was simply will@@ ful What was special about “ I A@@ m Not Mad@@ ame Bo@@ vary ” was the alter@@ n@@ ating circul@@ ar and square image com@@ positions . In particular , the circul@@ ar fra@@ mes shot with a ho@@ o@@ ded l@@ ens were fresh and interesting .
F@@ en@@ g Xia@@ og@@ ang explained , “ This theme was very similar to Director Z@@ hang Y@@ im@@ ou ’ s “ The St@@ ory of Q@@ i@@ u J@@ u ” , so it ’ s very easy for many to lu@@ mp the two together . So I started to think how I should sho@@ ot the film using a method no one has used before . Ac@@ tually , it wasn ’ t really a very special idea .

F@@ en@@ g Xia@@ og@@ ang said he regarded the work as his ma@@ iden work , and learned how to sho@@ ot circul@@ ar fra@@ mes from the cam@@ era people . He even spent a few million to allow the cam@@ era people to sho@@ ot a 10-@@ minute pilot .
Facebook to step up fac@@ t-@@ chec@@ king in fight against fake news
Facebook is to send more potential ho@@ a@@ x articles to third-@@ party fact chec@@ kers and show their findings below the original post , the world &apos;s largest online social network said on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day as it tries to fight so-called fake news .
The company said in a statement on its web@@ site it will start using up@@ dated machine learning to detect possible ho@@ ax@@ es and send them to fact chec@@ kers , potentially showing fac@@ t-@@ chec@@ king results under the original article .
Facebook has been criticized as being one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news , which many think influenced the 2016 U@@ .@@ S. presidential election .
The issue has also become a big political topic in Europe , with French voters delu@@ ged with false stories ahead of the presidential election in May and Germany backing a plan to fine social media networks if they fail to remove h@@ ateful post@@ ings promptly , ahead of elections there in September .
On Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fac@@ t-@@ chec@@ king feature was being launched in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; In addition to seeing which stories are disputed by third-@@ party fact chec@@ kers , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said S@@ ara S@@ u , Facebook news feed product manag@@ er , in a blo@@ g .
She added that Facebook would keep testing its &quot; related article &quot; feature and work on other changes to its news feed to cut down on false news .
Building a graphic novel : A C@@ ast@@ le in England &apos;s story
In its recent past , the di@@ minu@@ tive Scot@@ ney C@@ ast@@ le has feat@@ ured in a Squ@@ ee@@ ze music video and been a bol@@ tho@@ le for Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s .
But Scot@@ ney has witnessed 700 years of tu@@ mul@@ tuous history from its co@@ sy seat in Be@@ w@@ l River val@@ ley in K@@ ent , now inspiration for a graphic novel written by Jam@@ ie R@@ ho@@ des , a mo@@ p-@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pen@@ ch@@ ant for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says w@@ ist@@ fully .
&quot; What a personal connection , to hold that letter in my hand . &quot;
Span@@ ning the middle ages to the Ed@@ war@@ dian era , A C@@ ast@@ le in England documents the families that lived in Scot@@ ney , with each story illustr@@ ated by a different , upcoming UK arti@@ st - I@@ sa@@ ac Len@@ k@@ ie@@ w@@ ic@@ z , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Bec@@ ky Pal@@ mer and Is@@ ab@@ el Green@@ berg .
It is not R@@ ho@@ des &apos;s first book based on an arch@@ i@@ ve : he also wrote 2014 &apos;s De@@ ad M@@ en &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other St@@ ories , a collection inspired by documents in the British Li@@ br@@ ary - a project he found unexpectedly emotional .
&quot; I wel@@ led up at just the th@@ umb@@ print on the side of a letter , written by a double agent in the 17@@ 00@@ s who was working for the J@@ ac@@ ob@@ ites , &quot; he says .
&quot; That &apos;s his th@@ umb@@ print !
And let@@ ters always sm@@ ell like smo@@ ke because , back then , you lit a fire for light .
To someone 300 years in the future , the sm@@ ell makes it feel like they &apos;@@ re there , too .
A@@ h , I love arch@@ i@@ ves ! &quot;
For someone so sm@@ it@@ ten with old papers , getting support from the National Trust and Ar@@ ts Council England and living in a cast@@ le for almost four months ( &quot; I over@@ stayed my welcome a little bit , to be honest &quot; ) seems too good to be true .
R@@ ho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ an &quot; new &quot; cast@@ le , going through the arch@@ i@@ ves and studying the man@@ or &apos;s many tre@@ asures and curi@@ os , such as the moun@@ ted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and bott@@ les that had spent centuries in the mo@@ at .
He wan@@ dered the grounds and the ru@@ ins of the old cast@@ le , talking to rang@@ ers , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes the artists at work on his book &apos;s illustr@@ ations .
Then at night , he &apos;@@ d &quot; d@@ rink wh@@ is@@ key and get writing . &quot;
The intim@@ ate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust had only gained full access in 2006 when the final he@@ ir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
When R@@ ho@@ des arrived a decade later , staff were only starting to tackle the arch@@ i@@ ve , which he describes as &quot; hundreds of years of ar@@ ist@@ oc@@ rats going : &apos; O@@ h , stick it in the lo@@ ft &apos; . &quot;
Di@@ aries , let@@ ters from the days of the English empire , m@@ aps out@@ lining who owned what : &quot; You &apos;@@ d think land disputes would be bor@@ ing , &quot; says R@@ ho@@ des , &quot; but there was this one bir@@ ch tre@@ e two families were fighting over .
Just let it go , gu@@ ys ! &quot;
Some of the stories in the collection use the cast@@ le as a jum@@ p@@ ing-@@ off point to del@@ ve more broadly into English history , including The Lab@@ ou@@ rer , which follows a man who leaves the newly built cast@@ le to join the 13@@ 81 P@@ eas@@ ants &apos; R@@ evol@@ t .
&quot; There is a record of a ri@@ ot happening at the cast@@ le in 13@@ 80 , in this book called the K@@ n@@ igh@@ tly Fam@@ ili@@ es of K@@ ent and S@@ us@@ sex , &quot; says R@@ ho@@ des .
&quot; The P@@ eas@@ ants &apos; R@@ evol@@ t started in that area and I thought , a ri@@ ot is a good place to start .
Maybe the two are connected ? &quot;
Other stories are rooted firmly in the history of the cast@@ le - such as The Pri@@ est , which tells the tale of the Je@@ suit pri@@ est whom the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hi@@ d for seven years during the English Re@@ formation .
Or The Sm@@ ugg@@ ler , which features 18@@ th-century contra@@ ban@@ der Ar@@ th@@ ur Dar@@ rel@@ l , who is thought to have staged his own fun@@ eral by filling a coff@@ in with roc@@ ks ( a discovery made years later when his coff@@ in was un@@ ear@@ th@@ ed ) .
The Dar@@ rel@@ ls are R@@ ho@@ des &apos;s fav@@ our@@ ite Scot@@ ney family : &quot; The gent@@ le@@ men seemed to be quite ro@@ gu@@ ish , always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn &apos;t afford .
Differen@@ t generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bun@@ ch of hand@@ some gu@@ ys , with a k@@ n@@ ack for wo@@ o@@ ing he@@ i@@ resses . &quot;
With his as@@ sign@@ ment in the cast@@ le over , R@@ ho@@ des is on the hun@@ t for other sing@@ ular writing experiences .
He has completed a two-@@ week st@@ int in the Fin@@ nish wil@@ der@@ ness for a graphic novel about El@@ ä@@ m@@ ä@@ n@@ m@@ ä@@ ki , the site of an early 20@@ th-century san@@ at@@ ori@@ um that has since been rec@@ la@@ im@@ ed by nature .
But Scot@@ ney holds a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to leave , &quot; he says .
&quot; It was like : &apos; A@@ h , I &apos;@@ ve got to go deal with f@@ uc@@ king real life now . &apos; &quot;

All large energy companies are “ extremely wealthy ” . So which energy company in the world makes the most money ?
Y@@ est@@ er@@ day , P@@ F@@ C Energy published its 2011 list of the To@@ p 50 largest listed energy companies . US oil and gas producer Ex@@ x@@ on@@ Mo@@ bil retained its top position with a market valuation of US $ 40@@ 6.@@ 3 billion , closely followed by Petro@@ China and Royal Dutch S@@ hell .
Petro@@ China top@@ ped the P@@ F@@ C rankings twice in 2007 and 2009 , while Ex@@ x@@ on@@ Mo@@ bil ranked first place position for the other years .

According to P@@ F@@ C ’ s statistics , ...

It envis@@ ages reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stricter rules for ob@@ taining temporary work vis@@ as and restrictions on fam@@ il@@ y-@@ oriented vis@@ as .
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and are supported by the president .
The draft law is due to be discussed in the two cham@@ bers of Congress .
&quot; This law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and will do this by changing the way the US issues Green Car@@ ds to citizens from other countries .
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current scheme .
This new application process will benefit candidates who speak English , have financial resources to support themselves and show skills that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Trump , qu@@ oted by the American media .

For the purposes of optim@@ izing the environment of scen@@ ic areas , and building a beau@@ tify N@@ any@@ ue , the “ 6@@ 36 ” voluntary service team of the N@@ any@@ ue Dist@@ ric@@ t Tob@@ acco Mon@@ o@@ poly Administration ( B@@ ran@@ ch Comp@@ any ) carried out a “ hi@@ king to protect our forests and love our home@@ town ” environmental protection event .
The event received the support of all the cad@@ res and staff of the district Tob@@ acco Administration , and also attracted retired cad@@ res as well as the staff ’ s families , who came to participate in the environmental protection activities . Three generations of people from the elderly to children worked together , hi@@ ked up the mountain to protect the forests , and clean@@ ed up rub@@ b@@ ish , contributing their own effort to building a “ beautiful N@@ any@@ ue ” .
This voluntary service event was aimed at protecting the scen@@ ic resources of N@@ any@@ ue , and propag@@ ating the voluntary service concept of “ care for others , care for society , and care for nature ” . It also served to teach and pass on to the next generation the virtue of voluntary service .
It is understood that since the “ 6@@ 36 ” voluntary service team was founded in early April this year , the 16 members have carried out a series of voluntary service activities including visiting nee@@ dy retail customers , helping tobacco farmers care for tobacco leaves , and making donations to the Y@@ a ’ an earthquake victims , and have become a team of committed voluntary service activists that con@@ vey positive energy from their hearts .

The rise of sex robots is real , and we should be concerned
Just when you thought 2017 couldn &apos;t get any we@@ ir@@ der along comes a new report on the technological developments in the sex robo@@ t sector .
Y@@ ep .
Se@@ x robots are a big deal right now .
Recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Ro@@ bo@@ tics ( F@@ R@@ R ) released a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years .
According to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ it@@ us professor of robo@@ tics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co-@@ founder of the F@@ R@@ R , we need to start taking their rise seriously .
Cu@@ stom@@ ers can choose the robo@@ t &apos;s eye col@@ our , ni@@ pple shape and fing@@ ern@@ ail type .
&quot; People sn@@ ig@@ ger about them , but the companies are actually shi@@ pping quite a lot and we are going to see them a lot more , &quot; M@@ r Shar@@ key said at the launch of the new report .
Modern sex doll@@ s have evolved out of their b@@ low-@@ up counterparts into robots with a si@@ lic@@ on skin that is warm to the touch - with deliberately human-@@ like responses achieved by artificial intelligence .
The user can also &quot; custom@@ ise &quot; their robo@@ t to suit their persu@@ a@@ sions , choosing everything from the robo@@ t &apos;s eye col@@ our , ni@@ pple shape to fing@@ ern@@ ail type or col@@ our .
But it gets even more disturbing , with many of the robots posse@@ ssing &quot; person@@ alities &quot; that would make a Ste@@ p@@ ford W@@ i@@ fe look progressive .
Modern sex doll@@ s have evolved into robots with a si@@ lic@@ on skin .
The Re@@ al@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robo@@ t , for example , allows users to custom@@ ise their robots according to the traits they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
Then there are the Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy G@@ old sex robots , developed by True Com@@ pan@@ ion , which come with pre-@@ program@@ med person@@ alities , including &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ ra@@ h &quot; that gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wil@@ d W@@ end@@ y &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ ur@@ ous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy G@@ old has a personality which is matched as much as possible to your personality , &quot; the True Com@@ pan@@ ion web@@ site en@@ th@@ uses .
So she likes what you like , dis@@ likes what you dis@@ like , etc .
She also has mo@@ ods during the day just like real people !
She can be sle@@ ep@@ y , convers@@ ational or she can &apos; be in the mood &apos; ! &quot;
There are many disturbing aspects to the rise of sex robots - not least of which is the replacement of real , human relationships - but the sub@@ ser@@ vi@@ ent female traits , the ra@@ pe@@ y con@@ no@@ tations of making a move on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( read : resistant ) Far@@ ra@@ h , are the most concerning .
On its web@@ site , True Com@@ pan@@ ion li@@ k@@ ened Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy to a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; If woman ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can &apos;t men have a Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; the web@@ site states .
However , these sex robots are not a mere fe@@ tish or just another sex to@@ y .
Their emergence and increasing sophistic@@ ation points to something dar@@ ker and deeper within our culture , a retreat from the ideal of gender equality toward a desire for sex with sub@@ ju@@ g@@ ation as an op@@ tional add@@ -@@ on .
Most men , naturally , are not going to keep sex robots , and while the F@@ R@@ R noted their increasing popularity , they remain , for now , on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of consumer culture .
But what see@@ ps in from the f@@ ring@@ es can be highly in@@ structive as to the ten@@ or of the era we &apos;@@ re living in .
And many people aren &apos;t we@@ ird or offensive until the free market gives them the per@@ mission to be so .
There is little coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots have emerged at a time when women &apos;s rights are under threat across the globe , when there is a president in the White House who has bra@@ gged about sex@@ ually assa@@ ul@@ ting women .
The most ch@@ illing aspect of the TV series The H@@ and@@ ma@@ id &apos;s T@@ ale isn &apos;t the graphic imag@@ ery , the no@@ o@@ sed bodies and g@@ ou@@ ged eyes , but just how realistic that vision feels .
The Republic of G@@ ile@@ ad is a leap , but , right now , it doesn &apos;t feel like a large one .
The aim behind these sex robots is to create as much of a physical li@@ ken@@ ess to actual women ( albeit with por@@ n star proportions ) as technologically possible .
Their cre@@ ators want them to feel human to the touch , for them to m@@ im@@ ic the movement of a real body .
But , po@@ inte@@ dly , when it comes to their &quot; person@@ alities &quot; the robots do not represent real women .
They cannot break up with their compan@@ ion , or walk out .
They have no agency or back@@ -@@ story , nothing to suggest independence or anything that may disrupt the fantasy of total serv@@ itude .
They are pleasant sla@@ ves , in other words .
Or to put it into 2017 par@@ lance : hand@@ ma@@ id@@ ens .
“ The Great Wall ” tells the story of a Chinese elite t@@ roo@@ p in ancient times that batt@@ led vali@@ antly against the mon@@ ster Ta@@ o@@ tie on the world re@@ now@@ ned Great Wall of China .
The last episode of “ Hur@@ ry Up , Bro@@ ther ” S@@ eas@@ on 4 has been recorded . Deng Cha@@ o , leader of the “ R@@ un@@ ning M@@ an Te@@ am ” was inter@@ viewed via We@@ Ch@@ at by the reporters of Sh@@ en@@ yang E@@ ven@@ ing News and sy@@ d@@ .@@ com on May 30 . From “ Sup@@ er Sch@@ ol@@ ar ” in “ R@@ un@@ ning M@@ an ” to “ Fun@@ ny V@@ il@@ lain ” in “ De@@ vi@@ l and An@@ gel ” to “ Dec@@ ad@@ ent Gu@@ y ” Chen M@@ o , the impression Deng Cha@@ o gives to the audience is that of a “ flexible trans@@ former ” , constantly changing .
Deng Cha@@ o said , “ I won ’ t do the same thing over and over again in my acting career . I want to renew myself constantly . ”
Trump &apos;s great feat ?
Making Mitt Romney seem the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense
It has become a tru@@ ism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polar@@ ised the US electorate have , on a micro@@ -scale , torn families apart .
Around Christmas and Th@@ an@@ k@@ s@@ giving , newspapers in the US ab@@ ounded with advice colum@@ ns on how to deal with the hor@@ ror of Tru@@ mp@@ -@@ voting relatives .
We are all supposedly stra@@ ining to burst our fil@@ ter bubbles .
Less remar@@ ked on is the power of Trump to bring families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ous@@ in , a left-@@ leaning po@@ et who lives in Chicago and who &apos;s long been at log@@ ger@@ heads with Republicans in our family , has been visiting me in New York this week .
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
With Trump in the White House , everyone she knows , including the Republican sib@@ ling she had been b@@ ick@@ ering with about politics for decades , is suddenly and pecu@@ li@@ arly on the same side .
Around the din@@ ner table this is surely a good thing ; but it strikes me that , in a broader context , it carries significant risks .
The left has been in@@ vigor@@ ated by Trump , but the war@@ ping effect of his presidency has the power to push us all righ@@ tw@@ ards .
When we talk about &quot; normali@@ s@@ ation &quot; and Trump , we are ref@@ erring to the sc@@ ary possibility that his an@@ tics may one day cease to app@@ al .
There is an even sc@@ ari@@ er long-@@ range scenario , however , in which what Trump &quot; normali@@ ses &quot; are righ@@ tw@@ ing Republicans who , held up against his standards , suddenly seem the ep@@ it@@ ome of reasonable .
I find myself actively nostal@@ gic these days for Mitt Romney &apos;s qu@@ ain@@ t version of cra@@ zy - the dog on the car ro@@ of , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew what his tax return looked like ) - both of which , compared to Trump , seem very mild off@@ ences indeed .
When Trump goes , the next Republican candidate will merely have to be san@@ e to qualify as an im@@ measurable improvement .
While my c@@ ous@@ in was in town , we took our kids to the car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the biggest of the car@@ ou@@ sels run by the New York par@@ ks department , and the best three buc@@ ks you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t require ca@@ ffe@@ ine .
The hor@@ ses are th@@ under@@ ously huge , the fi@@ bre@@ -@@ gl@@ ass designs on the central cy@@ lin@@ der - all g@@ ur@@ ning c@@ low@@ ns and animals tw@@ ist@@ ing to look over their own shoul@@ ders in terror - utterly sin@@ ister , and the tin@@ k@@ ling music od@@ dly trans@@ porting .
So many of the cli@@ ches of a city dis@@ appoint : views from t@@ all buildings get old , sky@@ lines grow too familiar to offer much of a thri@@ ll , and the reality of the city doesn &apos;t live up to the dream .
Thir@@ ty-@@ five years later and I &apos;@@ m still not entirely over the day I discovered Swiss Co@@ tt@@ age is not , in fact , a Swiss co@@ tt@@ age - the theme pu@@ b , Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Co@@ tt@@ age , doesn &apos;t count - but a large r@@ ound@@ about in north London .
The Central Park car@@ ou@@ sel , however , is still a we@@ ir@@ dly mag@@ ical experience , to the extent that two two-@@ year-@@ olds , an 11@@ -year-old and two women in their 4@@ 0s can go on it and all have a great time .
If I could have rated the car@@ ou@@ sel I would have given it full marks , but than@@ k@@ fully nobody asked .
In a department store this week , on the other hand , I was required , before swi@@ ping my credit card , to rate my trans@@ ac@@ tional &quot; experience &quot; on a scale of one to five stars .
In the coffee shop at the corner of my street it &apos;s the same thing , plus the option to match the rating with a 15 % tip - this for buying something over the counter .
The effect of this is not only to slow down what should be a neutral exchange , but to put pressure on the ser@@ ver to in@@ ject personality into a situation where none is required .

Two Bulg@@ arians W@@ ere De@@ tained For Il@@ legal C@@ amp@@ ing in Greece
Two Bulg@@ arians were de@@ tained for illegal camp@@ ing in Greece , the Foreign Affairs Ministry announced , qu@@ oted by b@@ TV .
A group of il@@ legally camp@@ ing people , including the two Bulg@@ arians , was de@@ tained by the police in S@@ ith@@ onia in the morning of August 1 .
The same day they were released , while an investigation is currently underway .
The ministry of foreign affairs reported b@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were later released .
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camp@@ ing and are already imposing serious fines on anyone who is caught re@@ sting in a place not intended for the purpose .
Ch@@ ec@@ ks will continue throughout the season .

On May 18 , the Ministry of Finance issued the “ Administr@@ ative Me@@ asures for Special Re@@ wards and Sub@@ si@@ dies for the Struc@@ tural Ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ments of Industrial En@@ ter@@ pris@@ es ” , and will ar@@ range special rewards and subsidies amounting to a total of RM@@ B@@ 100 billion to help advance reduction of overcapacity in the coal and steel industries .
Recently , many local governments including that of Shanghai , S@@ han@@ x@@ i , Sh@@ and@@ ong , Ji@@ ang@@ s@@ u and He@@ il@@ ong@@ jiang have proposed reform opinions on reducing overcapacity .
In particular , many provinces have even proposed to actively lobby the Central Government for fiscal support to reduce overcapacity in their respective provinces .
One proof is that the overcapacity reduction target for coal announced by a mere eight provinces already account for 90 % of the coal overcapacity reduction plan nationwide .
At an interview with reporters , L@@ in Bo@@ q@@ i@@ ang , De@@ an of China Institute for Studies in Energy Policy at X@@ i@@ am@@ en University , believed that merely relying on the Central government ’ s RM@@ B@@ 100 billion to “ reduce overcapacity ” in the steel and coal industries is far from sufficient . More funds should come from local governments and enterprises . How should that be done ?
In the detailed implementation rules for reducing surplus coal capacity issued recently by S@@ han@@ x@@ i Prov@@ ince , it was proposed that S@@ han@@ x@@ i Co@@ king Coal Group should be restructured and transformed into a state-owned capital investment company , its assets and businesses should be re@@ organized and consolidated , and a new business model constructed .
The actual funding gap could be 3 times that of the subsidy . Earlier , Y@@ in We@@ im@@ in , Minister of Human Res@@ ources and Social Security , said that initial calculations showed that a total of 1.3 million employees in the coal industry and 500@@ ,000 in the steel industry were required to be re@@ settled as a result of “ reducing overcapacity ” .

Red meat , d@@ air@@ y , and ch@@ oc@@ ol@@ ate could help reli@@ eve I@@ B@@ D
Red meat and ch@@ oc@@ ol@@ ate may sound like a nightmare for your dig@@ es@@ tive system .
But a new study claims quite the opposite : a diet rich in me@@ at@@ -based prote@@ in and d@@ air@@ y tre@@ ats could help reli@@ eve symptoms of su@@ ffe@@ rers of inflam@@ mat@@ ory b@@ ow@@ el disease .
The incur@@ able condition , which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK , causes stom@@ ach cra@@ mps and blo@@ ating , recur@@ ring or bloody diarrhea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ re@@ dness .
While su@@ ffe@@ rers are usually advised to do@@ dge meat and d@@ air@@ y to so@@ o@@ the their symptoms , researchers at Washington University found prote@@ in &apos;s essential am@@ ino ac@@ id tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han helps develop immune cells that foster a tolerant g@@ ut .
Le@@ ad investig@@ ator D@@ r Mar@@ co Col@@ on@@ n@@ a explained immune cells pat@@ ro@@ l the g@@ ut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hidden in the food don &apos;t s@@ ne@@ ak into the body .
Cel@@ ls that are capable of triggering inflam@@ mation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance , protecting the body without damaging sensitive tis@@ su@@ es .
When the balance til@@ ts too far toward inflam@@ mation , inflam@@ mat@@ ory b@@ ow@@ el disease can result .
In experiments it was found a kind of toler@@ an@@ ce-@@ promoting immune cell appears in m@@ ice that carry a specific bacter@@ ium in their gu@@ ts .
And the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the cells &apos; appearance .
Pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or Col@@ on@@ n@@ a said : &apos; We established a link between one bacter@@ ial species - L@@ ac@@ to@@ bac@@ illu@@ s re@@ u@@ ter@@ i - that is a normal part of the g@@ ut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
The more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the m@@ ice had in their diet , the more of these immune cells they had . &apos; 
He suggested if the same works in humans , a combination of L@@ . re@@ u@@ ter@@ i and a tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ -@@ rich diet may foster a more tolerant , less inflam@@ mat@@ ory g@@ ut environment .
Po@@ st@@ doc@@ toral research@@ er D@@ r Lu@@ is@@ a Cer@@ v@@ ant@@ es-@@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan@@ was studying a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she discovered that one group of study m@@ ice had such cells but another group of the same strain but hous@@ ed separ@@ ately did not .
She suspected the difference had to do with the m@@ ice &apos;s g@@ ut micro@@ biom@@ es - the community of bacteria , viruses and fun@@ gi that normally live within the g@@ ast@@ ro@@ inte@@ st@@ inal tr@@ act .
The gu@@ ts of the m@@ ice were DNA sequ@@ enced and it was found six bacter@@ ial species present in the m@@ ice with the immune cells but absent from the m@@ ice without them .
M@@ ice re@@ ared in a ster@@ ile environment so they lacked a g@@ ut micro@@ bi@@ ome and do not develop this kind of immune cell were given L@@ . re@@ u@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells arose .
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , the researchers grew L@@ . re@@ u@@ ter@@ i in liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without bacteria - to im@@ mature immune cells isolated from m@@ ice .
The immune cells developed into the toler@@ an@@ ce-@@ promoting cells .
When the active component was pu@@ ri@@ fied from the liquid , it turned out to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han met@@ aboli@@ sm known as in@@ do@@ le-@@ 3-@@ lac@@ tic ac@@ id .
When the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the m@@ ice &apos;s feed , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han levels were hal@@ ved , the number of cells dropped by half .
D@@ r Cer@@ v@@ ant@@ es-@@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained people have the same toler@@ an@@ ce-@@ promoting cells as m@@ ice , and most of us shelter L@@ . re@@ u@@ ter@@ i in our g@@ ast@@ ro@@ inte@@ st@@ inal trac@@ ts .
It is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by@@ products from L@@ . re@@ u@@ ter@@ i induce the cells to develop in people as they do in m@@ ice , but def@@ ects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflam@@ mat@@ ory b@@ ow@@ el disease .
She said : &apos; The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage since these cells control inflam@@ mation on the inner surface of the inte@@ st@@ ines .
Pot@@ entially , high levels of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the presence of L@@ . re@@ u@@ ter@@ i may induce expansion of this population . &apos;

With the launching of the latest model of 0@@ 5@@ 4@@ A fri@@ gate at the end of 2017 , the number of 0@@ 5@@ 4@@ A fri@@ gate has reached 29 , approaching the sum of the 0@@ 5@@ 3@@ H series fri@@ g@@ ates . Since the first 0@@ 5@@ 4@@ A was launched in 2006 , the history of building 0@@ 5@@ 4@@ A has extended to 12 years . Building such a large number of high-@@ performance general purpose fri@@ g@@ ates is very rare in the history . Apart from China , the only comparable accompli@@ shment was made by the United States in the 1970s and 1980s when it built a host of &apos; Per@@ ry &apos; class fri@@ g@@ ates .
And the reason why it is necessary to build so many 0@@ 5@@ 4@@ A fri@@ g@@ ates is simple , that is , it is affordable , easy to operate , and doing so can make up for the defici@@ ency of Chinese Na@@ vel that has be@@ set the Nav@@ al for many years .
The 0@@ 5@@ 4@@ A fri@@ gate has been favored by the Chinese Nav@@ y for many years thanks to its high cost performance and good combat effectiveness . With a displacement of 4,000 tons , the war@@ ship is equipped with a 7@@ 6-@@ m@@ m main gun , and shared launching system for 32 H@@ Q@@ -@@ 16 and Fi@@ sh-@@ 8 anti-@@ sub@@ marine missiles , 8 Y@@ J@@ -@@ 8@@ 3 anti-@@ ship missiles and 1 Z@@ -@@ 9 helicopter . Although it was first built in 2006 and was designed even earlier , its combat effectiveness is not too bad even by today &apos;s standard . It can be ranked as medi@@ um@@ - to high level fri@@ gate among all the fri@@ g@@ ates in the world .
However , it is a war@@ ship designed at the beginning of the 21@@ st century after all . Ar@@ m@@ am@@ ents aside , its pro@@ pul@@ sion system and electronic ra@@ dar system lag significantly behind the current mainstream fri@@ g@@ ates in the world . Con@@ si@@ dering that similar fri@@ g@@ ates in Europe have been equipped with full electric pro@@ pul@@ sion , small multi-@@ function phased array ra@@ d@@ ars and large helicopter dec@@ ks , it is time to develop new models .
Then how should China develop its new fri@@ g@@ ates ? This has a direct bearing on its future orientation and the strategic direction of Chinese nav@@ y .
The future development of the Chinese Nav@@ y will inevitably aim at becoming the blu@@ e water nav@@ y , ro@@ am@@ ing in the vast@@ ness of the oceans . It should be able to deploy rapidly in areas that are closely related to China ’ s vital interests and demonstrate the presence of force . If necessary , it will use powerful combat capabilities to ensure that China ’ s vital interests in the region are not compromised . So , it seems that the new models of fri@@ g@@ ates will surely be huge ships that can ro@@ am the blu@@ e water .
Let &apos;s look at the posi@@ tioning of the new fri@@ g@@ ates in the future rank and f@@ ile of Chinese Nav@@ y . The future Chinese Nav@@ y should be similar to the US Nav@@ y . In addition to the necessary offshore defense ships , the other main ships will form an aircraft car@@ rier battle group or amp@@ hi@@ bi@@ ous attack group as the situation requires .
The new fri@@ g@@ ates in the future aircraft car@@ rier battle group should play the primary role in anti-@@ sub@@ marine and short-@@ range air defense operations . In the amp@@ hi@@ bi@@ ous attack group , they should provide protection to ships . According to these requirements , the new fri@@ g@@ ates must have strong anti-@@ sub@@ marine capability and good mid-@@ range air defense capability .
Based on the above posi@@ tioning , we can bol@@ dly imagine the rough appearance of the new fri@@ g@@ ates in the future .
First , the displacement will be increased significantly compared to the current 0@@ 5@@ 4@@ A model . It is estimated that the displacement of the new fri@@ gate will reach about 5000@@ -@@ 600@@ 0 tons . The ship will be equipped with a comprehensive electric pro@@ pul@@ sion system that combines a Q@@ C@@ 2@@ 80 modified gas tur@@ b@@ ine and two di@@ e@@ sel engines , improving the maximum speed to around 30 k@@ no@@ ts and significantly increase the cru@@ ise range . As for the weapon@@ ry , the 7@@ 6@@ m@@ m main gun and 11@@ 30 near-@@ range anti-@@ aircraft gun will be retained , but a H@@ Q@@ -@@ 10 launch system will be added . A shared ver@@ tical launching system for 3@@ 2-@@ 48 unit H@@ Q@@ -@@ 16 modified missile and Fi@@ sh-@@ 8 missiles will be fur@@ ni@@ shed at the back of the main gun . A large 8-@@ 16@@ -@@ unit ver@@ tical launching system should be fur@@ ni@@ shed at the middle-@@ to-@@ re@@ ar section of the h@@ ull for the launch of Y@@ J@@ -@@ 18 and new cru@@ ise missiles . H@@ ang@@ ars and par@@ king platforms will also be expanded for the par@@ king and storage of two 10-@@ ton helicop@@ ters . As for the electronic ra@@ dar systems , the high grade model will be equipped with a small four-@@ sided fixed pha@@ se-@@ control array ra@@ dar developed based on 34@@ 6@@ A@@ . the low grade model will be fur@@ ni@@ shed with multi-@@ function ro@@ t@@ ating phased array ra@@ dar similar to the ones on European fri@@ g@@ ates .
Thus , the overall level of the new fri@@ g@@ ates will edge into the world &apos;s top brac@@ ket , even comparable to the F@@ F@@ G fri@@ g@@ ates of the US@@ A .
Of course , these are only the author &apos;s con@@ j@@ ecture on domestically produced new fri@@ g@@ ates . Only when the new fri@@ g@@ ates are launched into the water can we know the truth . Let &apos;s anticipate the day .

China &apos;s household debt ratio is close to the United States . Is being unable to repay loan more frigh@@ tening than being unable to afford a home ?
Recently , everyone has been talking about the recent changes in real estate policies . Is it true that real estate policies have been loosen@@ ed ? Is the diversification of land supply going to bring down the housing prices ?
However , just when we were worried about real estate prices , macroeconomic controls and the future trend of the real estate market , the People &apos;s D@@ aily published an important commentary once again . Last time we discussed how People ’ s D@@ aily had set the tone for the regulation of real estate market through a commentary . This time , the commentary of People &apos;s D@@ aily deals with a topic that is more serious than the affor@@ d@@ ability of housing : can you repay the loan even if you can afford the down payment of a mortgage ?
Today , let &apos;s discuss the question more serious than buying a house : repay the loan .
I@@ . China &apos;s growing housing debt crisis
The People &apos;s D@@ aily Over@@ seas E@@ dition published a commentary ti@@ tled “ A@@ wards and Lo@@ ans : The Jo@@ y and Wor@@ ries of Str@@ ugg@@ ling Young People ” on January 17@@ th . The article cited some data from an report on the progress of nationwide financial deleveraging in the 3@@ r@@ th quarter jointly published by the National L@@ abor@@ atory of Finance and Development of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the National Bal@@ ance She@@ et Research Center in November 2017 . According to the report , the leverage ratio of the residents &apos; sector continues to climb , rising from 4@@ 7.@@ 4 % in the second quarter of 2017 to 4@@ 8.@@ 6 % in the third quarter , an increase of 1.3 % , which amounts to an increase of 3.@@ 8 % in the first three quarters of 2017 .
The residents sector accounts for an increasing share of the total debt in the real economy , and the leverage ratio has risen rapidly .
Re@@ lev@@ ant studies have shown that Chinese households &apos; debts in financial institutions are dominated by consumer loans , which account for about two-thirds of residents &apos; debts , which is about twice that of business loans .
Among the consumer loans , medi@@ um@@ - and long-term loans dominated by housing loans accounted for about 80 % , but short-term consumer loans grow faster than medi@@ um@@ - and long-term loans .
Moreover , the household debt ratio figure obtained in the study is only reflects the total amount of credit that the household sector ob@@ tains from financial institutions . In fact , many Chinese households borrow money from private sources including relatives and friends , creating a large amount invisible loans .
Se@@ eing such data , one cannot help but be stu@@ pe@@ fied . According to the statistical data of Sun@@ ing Financial Research Institute , the leverage ratio of Chinese households was only 3 % in 1996 and 18 % in 2008 . But this figure doubled in just six years since the trend of rapid growth of leverage ratio set in , reaching 3@@ 6.@@ 4 % . By the third quarter of 2017 , the leverage ratio of households has reached 4@@ 8.@@ 6 % .
Let &apos;s make another comparison . In May last year , H@@ S@@ BC issued an investigation report involving 10,000 respondents in 9 countries .
The investigation was targeted at young people in the millen@@ n@@ ial generation ( born between 1980 and 2000 ) in nine countries .
The report pointed out that China &apos;s young people who were born in 1980s and 1990s have a home ownership rate of 70 % , far ahead of Mexico at the second place ( 46 % ) , and twice the US level ( 35 % ) .
These figures reveals that compared to the problem of being unable to afford homes , the biggest risk of &apos; Gre@@ y R@@ hin@@ oc@@ er@@ os &apos; for Chinese residents at present is likely to be being unable to repay debt .
2 . Why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem ?
As we have analy@@ zed previously , although we have been saying that China ’ s housing prices are relatively high , China ’ s housing ownership rate is actually quite high compared to other countries in the world . So the urgent question facing a lot of friends is whether you can re@@ play the loan rather than the question of whether you can afford a home .
A quick review of the real estate market in the world leads to the conclusion that China ’ s real estate market hasn &apos;t experience major crisis except for the loc@@ alized crisis in H@@ ain@@ an Prov@@ ince as we mentioned before . This is because commer@@ ci@@ alization of property is a relatively recent phenomenon in China . However , it &apos;s alarming to note that the real estate crisis in the United States triggered a global financial tsunami in 2008 , just a decade ago .
The blame for the real estate crisis in the United States falls on two financial institutions : F@@ anni@@ e Ma@@ e and Fre@@ d@@ die Ma@@ c .
In the so called &apos; golden age &apos; of the United States , real estate companies sold their houses with very low down payments to the low-income people in order to expand sales . When the US economy was prosperous , the real estate market was also thriving . However , it did not last long . The stagnation of growth in the U@@ .@@ S. economy caused the income of home buyers to fall , which in turn caused the consumption expenditures of a large number of households began to decline .
Most U@@ .@@ S. families had both financial assets and real estate assets . At that time , almost all household assets of the low-income families were real est@@ ates , while the majority assets of the top 20 % high-income families were financial assets . As a result , poorer people in the United States have higher debt ratio .
A grave reality is that these people bought their houses when the economy was prosperous , so the money to pay the mortgage is also calculated based on their better income . When the income declined , the pressure on the mortgage increased as a result of floating nature of some subprime mortgage plans . Thus , the real estate problems of these American families gradually evolved into a real estate crises .
Some people cannot afford to pay their mortgages because their incomes were too low . The banks began to take over the houses from the home buyers who had defa@@ ulted on the loan , and then sold them at very low prices , resulting in a ste@@ p-@@ by-@@ step price fall in the area . This vicious cycle caused a further decline in housing prices . When the housing prices had fallen to a certain extent , more and more home buyers found that their house values became lower than their loans . Thus , more and more people stopped re@@ paying their home mortgages , resulting in a large number of bad debts .
In this way , a huge vicious circle formed :
“ Economy downturn – incomes fall – some people can ’ t repay mortgages – banks sell defa@@ ulted houses at low prices – house prices fall – more people stop paying home mortgages – banks sell houses again – prices fall again ... &quot;
The problem did not stop there . As house prices continue to fall , a new situation emerged : The money the bank got after auc@@ tioning the defa@@ ulted house was less than the loan the home bu@@ yer owed the bank , the home bu@@ yer still need to repay the loan . So stopping repayment does not necessarily mean that you are clean@@ ed of the debt . For example , if you paid a down payment of $ 600@@ ,000 and borrowed $ 2.4 million to buy a house worth $ 3 million at the time . When the house price falls to $ 2 million , you stop to repay the loan and give the house to the bank . After the bank auc@@ tions the house , you will not only lost your down payment of $ 600@@ ,000 , but also owed $ 400@@ ,000 debts to the bank . You still have to repay the debt .
Thus , with the effect of such vicious cycle one after another , the U@@ .@@ S. economy gradually collapsed and eventually triggered the U@@ .@@ S. financial crisis in 2008 .
Therefore , the fact that China ’ s household debt ratio has reached a high level of 4@@ 6.@@ 8 % is a problem that requires great vigil@@ ance . Although this figure is still lower than that of developed countries at present , the signs of the problem have already begun to emerge . The central government started to stress the issue of deleveraging repeatedly in the last year , which is a very pres@@ ci@@ ent judgment . If the household debt ratio is allowed to continue to climb , it will inevitably lead to a huge crisis . Therefore , we must strictly guard against the hidden financial risks .
It &apos;s no wonder that the central government has set the tone for the real estate market : H@@ ous@@ es are for living , not for speculation . The government are taking multiple measures to resolve potential risks , including increasing land and housing supply and encouraging house ren@@ ting .
For our individual families , we must abandon the mindset of specul@@ ating on real estate and make purchase according to our own financial capacities . In this way , we can prevent our families from falling under huge financial burden . A reasonable assessment of one &apos;s own income and debt levels is essential for healthy growth of family wealth .

White House Pro@@ p Co@@ st Ta@@ x@@ pay@@ ers Th@@ ous@@ ands
The White House &apos;s decision to fly a Marine helicopter to the South L@@ awn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers as much as $ 24@@ ,000 , according to military records released to T@@ IM@@ E .
The green@@ -and-@@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H@@ -@@ 3@@ D , known as Marine One when the President is abo@@ ard , was the center@@ piece of the July 17 event at the White House show@@ c@@ asing American construction programs .
President Donald Trump , Vice President Mi@@ ke P@@ ence and senior White House officials tou@@ red manufacturing products from all 50 states .
The Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ u@@ t-@@ made helicopter was disp@@ layed alongside a y@@ ach@@ t from Main@@ e , a fire tr@@ uck from W@@ is@@ con@@ sin , and a for@@ k@@ lift from Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i .
The White House Military Office requested the helicopter &apos;s presence in a fragment@@ ary order , or F@@ R@@ A@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter lan@@ ded on the South L@@ awn for the &quot; unusual &quot; event , according to the records of Marine He@@ licop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ X@@ -@@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operating the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because it &apos;s such an unusual high vi@@ sibility event , &quot; the commander of H@@ M@@ X@@ -@@ 1 em@@ ailed his superior , the Marine Deputy Com@@ man@@ d@@ ant for Avi@@ ation , the day before the event .
The message indicated the helicopter would arrive on the South L@@ awn at approximately 7 a@@ .@@ m@@ . on July 17 for the 3 p@@ .@@ m@@ . event , and remain until the law@@ n was cle@@ ared between 6 p@@ .@@ m@@ . and 9 p@@ .@@ m@@ . that ev@@ ening .
The note adds that should the departure from the White House be delayed , a second air@@ cre@@ w would be needed for the return flight due to du@@ ty-@@ hour restrictions .
The original flight cre@@ w was with the helicopter during the event , while unit security personnel remained with the aircraft while it was the ground .
It was not clear from records provided to T@@ IM@@ E whether a second flight cre@@ w was ultimately required .
The H@@ at@@ ch Act prohib@@ its federal employees from using government property for political purposes .
Rec@@ or@@ ds indicate that H@@ M@@ X@@ -@@ 1 in@@ qui@@ red about whether the event might violate the provision .
&quot; One question we asked was if it was a violation of the H@@ at@@ ch Act and were informed it was not , &quot; the commander wrote .
&quot; S@@ ounds like you are locked , &quot; the Deputy Com@@ man@@ d@@ ant replied .
The &quot; M@@ ade in America &quot; event was designated an official event by the White House , and would not have been covered by the H@@ at@@ ch Act .
But even official events have political over@@ t@@ ones .
At the event , the President made a push for healthcare reform efforts then underway in the Senate and tou@@ ted efforts to rein in government regulations .
Using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advant@@ ag@@ eous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
Presidents are required to use them for travel .
But requi@@ si@@ tioning their use solely for a pho@@ to-@@ o@@ p is unusual .
Trump drew scrutiny in February when the presidential air@@ plane tax@@ ied to the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne , F@@ la . , and his Twitter account is fl@@ ush with messages compla@@ ining about his predecessor &apos;s use of the presidential aircraft .
&quot; The White House is thri@@ l@@ led with the &apos; M@@ ade In America &apos; show@@ case that feat@@ ured products from all 50 states that are made by American workers with American materials , &quot; said White House deputy press secretary L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ M@@ X@@ -@@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training f@@ lights around the Washington area and at the South L@@ awn to practice depos@@ iting the President of the United States at the White House with in@@ ches of precision .
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July , H@@ M@@ X@@ -@@ 1 conducted 58 practice land@@ ings at the White House .
The flight for the M@@ ade in America event counted toward the air@@ cre@@ w &apos;s training requirement for the month , an official said .
Un@@ it helicop@@ ters also fle@@ w an additional 11 hours that day for &quot; non-@@ presidential support missions . &quot;
The White House said taxpayers did not pick up the burden for any of the other pro@@ ps feat@@ ured at the event .
A spokes@@ person for S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said the company was not involved in ar@@ ranging for the helicopter to be disp@@ layed on the South L@@ awn .
H@@ M@@ X@@ -@@ 1 doesn &apos;t maintain budgetary records for presidential f@@ lights , and determining the precise cost incurred by the event is difficult .
But according to Department of Defense h@@ our@@ ly rates for fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D re@@ im@@ bur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H@@ -@@ 3@@ D is $ 24@@ ,@@ 3@@ 80 per flight hour .
Un@@ it records record the aircraft flight time as 30 minutes each way from its home base at Marine Cor@@ ps Air Facility Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o in Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
The White House argues the true cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate .
&quot; To place a cost to taxpayers based on the re@@ im@@ bur@@ sement rate estimates is highly misleading , &quot; Wal@@ ters said .
&quot; These rate estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other sun@@ k costs that are included in annual appropri@@ ations . &quot;
According to a 2015 RAN@@ D study , Do@@ D re@@ im@@ bur@@ sement rates do not include the cost of personnel , but do account for fuel , maintenance , and contracting costs .
At the time , former White House press secretary Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; The idea is to show@@ case this week things that are made in America , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said .
&quot; And I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security , that there are , I assume , hundreds if not thousands of people whose job depends on that .
And I think , like most Americans , we &apos;@@ re all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans worked ti@@ re@@ lessly to do .
So , of course , it &apos;s appropriate to highlight that . &quot;
It wasn &apos;t clear whether Trump inter@@ acted with the helicopter as he tou@@ red the South L@@ awn for the event , but he did step into the driver &apos;s seat of a fire tr@@ uck .
In@@ side the White House , Trump addressed S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky representatives , jo@@ king with the media about his own fle@@ et of company products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; the President said , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

Based on the largest floor area of a small to medium-@@ sized unit , at least 30@@ 3 small and medium-@@ sized units could be offered at this site .
It is understood that this site is located directly east of Hu@@ ang@@ p@@ u Inter@@ change , and across the road from Guang@@ zhou Tian@@ he Ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ecture De@@ sign Institute . A@@ men@@ ities around the site are comprehensive . It is the first li@@ sting of a residential site in the Tian@@ he Dist@@ ric@@ t this year .

Neigh@@ b@@ ors also said that flow@@ ers blo@@ oming on the money tre@@ e is a rare sight . Re@@ sidents of the housing estate felt that this was very a@@ uspic@@ ious , and came to take a look out of interest after learning about the matter .
The scientific name for the money tre@@ e is “ Mal@@ ab@@ ar Ch@@ est@@ n@@ ut ” , a tropical plant native to Mexico . It perfor@@ ms best in warm and dam@@ p conditions , and its flow@@ ers will only bloo@@ m under appropriate conditions such as sun@@ light , water and nutri@@ ments .
Even in the wild where tropical conditions are appropriate , flow@@ ers blo@@ oming on money trees are rare . It was once said that the “ chance of flow@@ ers blo@@ oming is one in a thousand ” .
Y@@ est@@ er@@ day morning , reporters visited the N@@ an@@ ning M@@ ach@@ in@@ ery Office dor@@ mit@@ ory at Min@@ zh@@ u Road . L@@ ed by A@@ unt G@@ ao , the reporters saw the money tre@@ e .
Plan@@ ted amid the f@@ lower bed of the housing estate , the money tre@@ e was about five meters t@@ all , and the branch circum@@ ference , at its th@@ ic@@ kest , measured approximately 30 c@@ m . Its leaves were emer@@ ald green and lux@@ uri@@ ant .
The flow@@ ers blo@@ omed at ti@@ ps of higher branches , and the flow@@ ers that were in full bloo@@ m were more than 10 c@@ m wide . The delicate p@@ ale yel@@ low fil@@ am@@ ents were ev@@ enly spread out , and the green bu@@ ds , when burst , cur@@ led back@@ wards on both sides . The fine and den@@ se st@@ am@@ ens resemb@@ led silver thre@@ ads with gold stars at their ti@@ ps .
A@@ unt G@@ ao told the reporters that the money tre@@ e has been plan@@ ted for eight years . When it was first plan@@ ted , it was about one me@@ ter t@@ all ; it is now more than five meters t@@ all .
It was originally a pot@@ ted plant when her son first bought it from the f@@ lower and b@@ ird market , and was subsequently plan@@ ted in the f@@ lower bed . She did not have to take particular care of it , but would occasionally earth it up .

Sh@@ ic@@ hang X@@ ing@@ ba@@ o reported that between 2005 and 2011 , the GDP of An@@ hu@@ i Prov@@ ince rose from joint “ bottom ” to second at one stro@@ ke .
However , the Prov@@ ince ’ s economic growth continued to experience difficulties such as low investment efficiency , and a lack of core competitiveness in its industrial economy . To this end , the latest issue of the “ Economic Blu@@ e P@@ aper ” of the Prov@@ ince ’ s Economic Information Center advised raising the quality and benefit of economic growth .
We have made a comparison of some of the representative indices of the Prov@@ ince ’ s economy between 2005 and 2011 with that of the nation and Central China .
In 2011 , in terms of industrial economic benefit , high energy consumption industries such as industrial energy and raw materials , which comp@@ ris@@ ed a relatively large proportion of the Prov@@ ince , had to endure “ twin pressures ” - they were significantly affected by market volatility as well as overcapacity . At the same time , home appli@@ ances , autom@@ o@@ tive and other leading industries lacked innovation , resulting in sli@@ m profits .
Meanwhile , enormous investment did not bring about the corresponding economic benefit , which was a key factor leading to poor quality and benefit in economic growth .
As regards this , experts advised that effective measures should be adopted to incenti@@ vi@@ ze enterprises to innovate . The technical outcomes of Institu@@ tions of higher learning and technological research institu@@ tes should also be promptly “ transferred ” to enterprises .
As for low industrial economic benefit , experts said that industry mer@@ ger and re@@ organization should be actively advanced , industry structure optim@@ ized , and the industry chain extended .

G@@ M@@ B concern over investment at Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s Glas@@ go@@ w factory

G@@ M@@ B Scotland said the company had been silent over the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
More than 500 people work at the plant , which produces H@@ ob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cu@@ its , among other products .
Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s owner Pl@@ ad@@ is said it had invested more than £ 5@@ m at the site in the last few years .
It added employees and union representatives &quot; will be the first to know &quot; if there were any changes to its operations .
In a letter to the company &apos;s site manag@@ er , G@@ M@@ B Scotland called on Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s to &quot; address concerns that funding is not being brought forward for the modern@@ is@@ ation of production lines . &quot;
G@@ M@@ B senior organ@@ is@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ff@@ y , said : &quot; The fact that we cannot get clarity from the general site manag@@ er over the business needs and investment plan for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply concerning our members .
Gener@@ ations of families have worked here and the workforce is highly concentrated in the local community and the greater Glas@@ go@@ w area , a crucial pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social de@@ priv@@ ation .
So , from the perspective of jobs , pay and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Brexit , rising cost of living and chronic manufacturing decline , the east end of Glas@@ go@@ w desperately needs a thriving manufacturing presence at Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s . &quot;
A spokes@@ woman for Pl@@ ad@@ is said : &quot; The site manag@@ er at T@@ oll@@ cross received a letter from G@@ M@@ B Scotland only yester@@ day and the company will be responding directly as we value ongoing engagement with employees and union representatives .
We had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ M@@ B representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross two months ago at which a number of issues were discussed openly .
We discussed with employees then that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we review our operations on an ongoing basis - and that applies across our all our businesses and sites - in order to remain competitive .
She added : &quot; In recent years , we have invested over £ 5@@ m in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , notably on production lines and operational improvements .
We fully recogn@@ ise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a manufacturing site and should there be any changes to our operations at the site , employees and their union representatives will be the first to know . &quot;

On May 10 , environmental protection volunte@@ ers loaded rub@@ b@@ ish that have been sor@@ ted onto tr@@ uc@@ ks .
China News Service / He P@@ eng@@ le@@ i : In the last 10 years or so , environmental protection issues at Moun@@ t E@@ ve@@ rest have become increasingly prominent as the number of Moun@@ t E@@ ve@@ rest explo@@ rers and tourists increased significantly .
In the Spring of 1997 , the Tibet A@@ ut@@ onom@@ ous Regi@@ on Moun@@ taine@@ ering Association initiated the first clean-@@ up on the Northern slo@@ pe of Moun@@ t E@@ ve@@ rest , clean@@ ing up ox@@ y@@ gen tanks and other domestic waste left over from the 1960s and 1970s . This video was also sp@@ ecially broadcast at the Conference of the Par@@ ties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Kyoto that year , drawing world attention .
According to N@@ y@@ ima T@@ ser@@ ing , after 1997 , public interest groups arrived suc@@ ces@@ sively to help clean up the Northern slo@@ pe of Moun@@ t E@@ ve@@ rest , but most of the participants were non-@@ professionals .
D@@ id P@@ S@@ G warn Bar@@ cel@@ ona about move for N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
La L@@ ig@@ a side may ru@@ e their interest in Mar@@ co Ver@@ r@@ att@@ i
Paris S@@ ain@@ t-@@ Ger@@ main will not let up in their pursuit of N@@ ey@@ mar after lo@@ d@@ ging a £ 189@@ m offer to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Bar@@ cel@@ ona of the world-@@ record raid three years ago ?
The sen@@ s@@ ational approach has lit up the summer transfer window , with the L@@ ig@@ ue 1 club ready to break the world transfer record by more than double the previous mark , which saw Paul Po@@ g@@ ba return to Manch@@ ester United last season for £ 8@@ 9@@ m .
Once completed , the move will see N@@ ey@@ mar become the world &apos;s most expensive player and also the high@@ est-@@ paid professional s@@ port@@ s@@ man in the world , with P@@ S@@ G offering wages of over £ 500@@ ,000-@@ a-@@ week after tax .
Bar@@ cel@@ ona are known to be furi@@ ous with the manner of the approach and the way that N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , despite a source close to the Catal@@ ans &apos; board insisting that the club have always done their best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 .
But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the P@@ S@@ G president ?
When Manch@@ ester City expressed an interest in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i in 2014 , N@@ asser Al-@@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a stern warning for any club looking to sign one of P@@ S@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we &apos;@@ ll contact their players , &quot; Al-@@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi said .
&quot; We respect all clubs .
But if they try to sign one of our players , they &apos;@@ ll face consequences . &quot;
Bar@@ cel@@ ona appear to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressing an interesting in P@@ S@@ G mid@@ fi@@ el@@ der Mar@@ co Ver@@ r@@ att@@ i earlier this summer .
P@@ S@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances , and Bar@@ cel@@ ona could well be feeling the repercussions of that interest by losing one of their prize assets in N@@ ey@@ mar .
By staff repor@@ ter W@@ ang Y@@ ich@@ en : The International Conference on R@@ ene@@ w@@ able Energy Development and Technology jointly organized by State G@@ rid Corporation of China ( S@@ GCC ) and the International Elec@@ tro@@ technical Commission was held in Frankfurt , Germany recently .
At present , accelerating the development of renewable energy , and advancing transformation toward clean and low-carbon energy have become a global trend .
However , large-scale development and use of renewable energy continued to be assa@@ iled by system security , long-@@ distance delivery , technology economic and other issues and challenges that need to be confronted and resolved .
