28@@ -@@ Y@@ ear@@ -@@ Old Ch@@ ef F@@ ound De@@ ad at San Francisco M@@ all
A 28@@ -year-old ch@@ ef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the st@@ air@@ well of a local m@@ all this week .
But the victim &apos;s brother says he can &apos;t think of anyone who would want to hurt him , saying , &quot; Things were finally going well for him . &quot;
The body found at the West@@ field M@@ all W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day morning was identified as 28@@ -year-old San Francisco re@@ sident Frank G@@ ali@@ ci@@ a , the San Francisco Medical Ex@@ am@@ in@@ er &apos;s Office said .
The San Francisco Poli@@ ce Department said the death was ruled a hom@@ ic@@ ide and an investigation is ongoing .
The victim &apos;s brother , Lou@@ is G@@ ali@@ ci@@ a , told A@@ BC station K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , previously a line co@@ ok in Boston , had lan@@ ded his dream job as line ch@@ ef at San Francisco &apos;s S@@ ons &amp; D@@ au@@ ghters restaur@@ ant six months ago .
A spokes@@ person for S@@ ons &amp; D@@ au@@ ghters said they were &quot; shocked and devastated &quot; by his death .
&quot; We are a small team that operates like a close k@@ n@@ it family and he will be de@@ arly missed , &quot; the spokes@@ person said .
Our though@@ ts and con@@ dol@@ ences are with Frank &apos;s family and friends at this difficult time .
Lou@@ is G@@ ali@@ ci@@ a said Frank initially stayed in ho@@ st@@ els , but recently , &quot; Things were finally going well for him . &quot;
&quot; He found an apar@@ tment , he was dating a gir@@ l , &quot; Lou@@ is G@@ ali@@ ci@@ a told K@@ GO .
Lou@@ is G@@ ali@@ ci@@ a said he could not think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother .
He was a kind spirit with a big heart .
His way of connecting with the family was always making us a dish , making us din@@ ner , &quot; Lou@@ is G@@ ali@@ ci@@ a said .
He never wanted to be in any kind of alter@@ c@@ ation .
He was the brother that went with the flow .
&quot; With everything else that &apos;s going wrong with the world , he was that diam@@ ond in the rough that was sh@@ ining bright every day , &quot; he said .

J@@ uni@@ or doctors strike : C@@ alls for fresh industrial action
Representatives of j@@ uni@@ or doctors have called on their union to auth@@ ori@@ se fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contract .
The J@@ uni@@ or Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) is to ask its full council to back more industrial action from early September .
The J@@ DC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contract .
J@@ uni@@ or doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal agreed with the BM@@ A .
It was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the ballot .
In a letter to members released on Twitter on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day night , the J@@ DC &apos;s chair El@@ len Mc@@ Court said the government had remained &quot; persistently silent &quot; on issues which , she said , had resulted in the contract being rejected .
She said : &quot; In light of this , the J@@ DC Executive has voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and to call for formal re-@@ negotiations on all of your concerns . &quot;
In response to the government &apos;s silence , J@@ DC ex@@ e@@ c has today made a formal request for a special meeting of BM@@ A Council to auth@@ ori@@ se a rolling program@@ me of escal@@ ated industrial action beginning in early September .
The dispute has led to j@@ uni@@ or doctors taking part in six strikes this year , including the first all-@@ out stop@@ pages in the history of the N@@ H@@ S .
The BM@@ A &apos;s j@@ uni@@ or doctor leader , D@@ r Jo@@ han@@ n Mal@@ aw@@ ana , resigned following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contract , which the BM@@ A had recommended .
He had told BM@@ A members the deal was a good one that should be accepted , during meetings ahead of the poll of 5@@ 4,000 j@@ uni@@ or doctors and medical students .
Following the vote , Health Secretary Jeremy H@@ unt said the contract would be imposed on medic@@ s in England .
Russia and Turkey : An &apos; alliance of mis@@ fits &apos; ?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis .
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tu@@ es@@ day to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eigh@@ t-@@ month long war of words and economic sanctions .
But , as Vladimir Putin gre@@ eted his Turkish counterpart in the g@@ il@@ ded h@@ all of a St. Peter@@ s@@ burg pal@@ ace , I got the distinct impression that An@@ k@@ ara wants this reconciliation the most .
There was the hand@@ shake , yes .
But M@@ r Putin &apos;s sm@@ ile looked thin and he was hardly o@@ o@@ zing war@@ m@@ th even by his own restra@@ ined standards .
Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan by contrast talked repeatedly of his &quot; de@@ ar friend &quot; M@@ r Putin - five times , according to one report .
I lost count .
He also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level , but even higher .
The next day one newspaper here described M@@ r Erdo@@ gan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened .
To me , his enthusiasm implied the opposite .
But a lingering co@@ ol@@ ness emanating from M@@ r Putin showed that Russia &apos;s leader has forgotten nothing .
In fact , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments : Turkey &apos;s shooting down of a Russian figh@@ ter plane on the Syrian border .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was furi@@ ous .
M@@ r Putin l@@ ashed out , acc@@ using An@@ k@@ ara of st@@ ab@@ bing Moscow in the back .
The off@@ ence was even greater , coming from a supposed friend .
Re@@ building real trust will be hard , perhaps impossible .
Russian public opinion has also turned since November .
For months , state-@@ controlled media conducted a staggering , all-@@ out offensive against An@@ k@@ ara .
All of a sudden , it seemed like Turks were to blame for everything .
Most serious were accusations from top officials that M@@ r Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family has prof@@ ited from an illegal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State .
He &apos;s denied that emp@@ h@@ atically .
But in St. Peter@@ s@@ burg came the official message that it &apos;s time to move on .
After all , this meeting only happened because M@@ r Putin got the apo@@ logy he demanded from President Erdo@@ gan .
Russia could claim a victory of sorts .
For An@@ k@@ ara the benefits of calling a tru@@ ce are clear .
First and foremost , Erdo@@ gan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ou@@ sted from power last month in a failed coup .
Re@@ pe@@ at terror attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him too .
There is also an economic motive .
Russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on char@@ ter f@@ lights , which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
The number has slu@@ mped by almost 90 % .
As for Russia , tour operators and char@@ ter companies here will certainly be reli@@ ev@@ ed when f@@ lights eventually resume .
They &apos;@@ re banking on a l@@ ate-@@ season rush to the Mediterranean .
And even this week , state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vege@@ tables once Turkish agricultural imports are permitted again .
&quot; T@@ ou@@ rists that way , tom@@ ato@@ es back here , &quot; as a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i newspaper ph@@ ra@@ sed it .
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow .
An@@ k@@ ara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover .
Add to that its long-standing g@@ ru@@ dge at the sn@@ ail &apos;s pace of talks to join the EU and step in M@@ r Putin - who is keen to capit@@ ali@@ se on the ch@@ ill and chi@@ p away at Turkey &apos;s ties with the West .
The Russian leader certainly won bon@@ us points with An@@ k@@ ara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attempted coup .
M@@ ind you , that &apos;s a given for Moscow which has its own deep-@@ se@@ ated fear of regime change .
So the summit at this g@@ lit@@ zy , se@@ aside pal@@ ace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analy@@ st described to me as an &quot; alliance of mis@@ fits &quot; : two countries that feel rejected and mist@@ re@@ ated by the West , joining forces .
Still , despite the public display of reconciliation , the two still have major differences .
The key one is Syria , where Moscow has recently been casting itself as peac@@ em@@ aker but where Russia and Turkey back opposite sides .
It could be telling that after almost three hours of initial talks , the two presidents told a press conference that they had@@ n &apos;t even tou@@ ched on the topic .
Turkey &apos;s president deliberately avoided answ@@ ering a question on their differences , while M@@ r Putin chose to under@@ line them .
There is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on Syria .
But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for ut@@ ter disaster when Na@@ to member Turkey shot down that Russian figh@@ ter j@@ et - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again .
Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside Scotland
The brand R@@ BS is to be reduced to a back office role , according to the bank &apos;s chief executive .
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland .
Ro@@ ss Mc@@ E@@ wan told B@@ BC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the bank &apos;s global ambitions .
It has re@@ treated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out .
During that time , brand strategi@@ sts have used &apos; R@@ BS &apos; to protect other consumer finance bran@@ ds .
It was backed with millions of p@@ ounds in spon@@ sorship of international sport , from Six Nations rug@@ by to W@@ im@@ b@@ led@@ on champion An@@ dy Mur@@ ray .
But now , it has been judged right to let more national bran@@ ds come to the fore .
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers , but will not be initi@@ ali@@ sed .
In England and Wal@@ es , all R@@ BS referen@@ ces , outside head office and the stock exchange li@@ sting , will be changed to Nat@@ West .
The Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
There are other , smaller bran@@ ds for private banking , which will get more promin@@ ence - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; C@@ o , Dru@@ m@@ mon@@ d , and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
M@@ r Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a tour of customers and staff in In@@ ver@@ ne@@ ss-@@ sh@@ ire .
He told B@@ BC Scotland : &quot; The R@@ BS brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with , because we are now becoming much more a bank of bran@@ ds . &quot;
As the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became the global brand .
I &apos;@@ m now saying we no longer have global aspirations , we have local aspirations .
Each one of those bran@@ ds will stand for something quite different in their own communities , and our staff will work with customers under those bran@@ ds .
R@@ BS had already stated that it would not to continue its Six Nations spon@@ sorship , and it has been raising the profile of different bran@@ ds in its sports spon@@ sorship .
&quot; The time is right for us to move to the bank of bran@@ ds , because under@@ ne@@ ath ( we &apos;@@ ve been asking ) how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the chief executive .
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we &apos;@@ d said we &apos;@@ re going to be a great bank for customers and put those bran@@ ds out there .
But with the work we &apos;@@ ve been doing , foc@@ us@@ sing on the customers needs , not our own , I think you &apos;@@ re seeing a lot of change .
We can bring those bran@@ ds back up again , so I think the time is right .
Fran@@ ki@@ e De@@ tt@@ or@@ i reaches 3,000 winners with victory at New@@ market on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
De@@ tt@@ or@@ i spra@@ ys champ@@ agn@@ e after a double at New@@ market takes him to 3,000 wins
J@@ oc@@ key Fran@@ ki@@ e De@@ tt@@ or@@ i secured his 3,000@@ th British winner at New@@ market on Fri@@ day .
He brought up the landmark with his second winner of the night at his local track - on Pre@@ dil@@ ection , trained by John Go@@ s@@ den .
The 4@@ 5-@@ year-old Italian is the sixth j@@ oc@@ key to reach the landmark in F@@ l@@ at rac@@ ing .
He follows S@@ ir Gordon Ric@@ har@@ ds , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester P@@ ig@@ go@@ tt , P@@ at Ed@@ der@@ y and Willi@@ e Car@@ son .
Thre@@ e-@@ time champion j@@ oc@@ key De@@ tt@@ or@@ i , who earlier won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; It &apos;s special . &quot;
I &apos;@@ m very emotional because my family are here as well
I &apos;@@ m very ple@@ ased for it to have happened at New@@ market because this is where I lan@@ ded 30 years ago .
It &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not a Royal A@@ sco@@ t - it &apos;s a mun@@ dane Fri@@ day night with 20,000 people .
I &apos;@@ m reli@@ ev@@ ed and very hum@@ ble .
De@@ tt@@ or@@ i so@@ aks up the che@@ ers as he brings in Pre@@ dil@@ ection after victory
Two j@@ oc@@ keys have reached the milestone in jump rac@@ ing - champion j@@ oc@@ key Richard Johnson and retired 20-@@ time champion S@@ ir An@@ th@@ ony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who had more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record-@@ breaking career .
L@@ ester P@@ ig@@ go@@ tt , n@@ ine-@@ time D@@ er@@ by winner , 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career wins
Fran@@ ki@@ e is one of the best j@@ oc@@ keys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this landmark so few have achieved before him .
He is sty@@ lish and strong , but it is his tactical n@@ ous that sets him apart from others in the weigh@@ ing room .
He is a fant@@ astic ambassador for rac@@ ing , his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans to the sport for years .
I said to Fran@@ ki@@ e a few weeks ago at E@@ p@@ so@@ m he &apos;@@ d have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn &apos;t just a wee@@ k@@ end and big@@ -@@ race j@@ oc@@ key !
Ser@@ i@@ ously though , Fran@@ ki@@ e &apos;s been riding winners in the UK for the best part of 30 years which is great to see .
He &apos;s a li@@ vely character which is good for British rac@@ ing but more than that , he &apos;s an incre@@ di@@ ble j@@ oc@@ key .
Fran@@ ki@@ e De@@ tt@@ or@@ i celebrated the milestone with a trade@@ mark flying dis@@ mount
From flying fin@@ i@@ shes to flying dis@@ moun@@ ts , Fran@@ ki@@ e De@@ tt@@ or@@ i has been the po@@ ster boy of British F@@ l@@ at rac@@ ing for two decades .
It has been a rol@@ l@@ er@@ coast@@ er ride .
St@@ acks of big@@ -@@ race winners , including his famous 1996 &apos; Magn@@ ific@@ ent S@@ even &apos; at A@@ sco@@ t , but he also survived a plane crash and served a drugs ban .
Three years ago he initially struggled when returning from that six-@@ month susp@@ ension , but he showed formidable strength of character to def@@ y the doub@@ ters and return to his best .
And he may not be done for some time - De@@ tt@@ or@@ i has previously said he would like to carry on competing until the age of 50 , at least .
Russia &apos;s Putin s@@ acks chief of staff Serge@@ i I@@ van@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Serge@@ i I@@ van@@ ov .
M@@ r I@@ van@@ ov has been part of M@@ r Putin &apos;s trusted inner circle for many years .
The 6@@ 3-@@ year-old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues .
A statement from the Kremlin said that M@@ r Putin had &quot; decre@@ ed to reli@@ eve I@@ van@@ ov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration , &quot; but gave no reason .
M@@ r I@@ van@@ ov &apos;s deputy since 2012 , An@@ ton V@@ ain@@ o , has been appointed as his successor .
M@@ r V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplomat .
Bor@@ n in the Est@@ onian capital T@@ all@@ in@@ n in 1972 , he gradu@@ ated from the presti@@ gious Moscow State Institute of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IM@@ O ) and served in the Tokyo embassy .
Later he managed presidential protocol and government staff , the Kremlin web@@ site says ( in Russian ) .
On being appointed , he told M@@ r Putin : &quot; Th@@ an@@ k you for your trust . &quot;
I think the administration &apos;s most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of dra@@ fting laws and control over how your instruc@@ tions are implemented .
M@@ r Putin told a Russian TV station on Fri@@ day that M@@ r I@@ van@@ ov had asked to leave the post , and recommended that M@@ r V@@ ain@@ o should replace him .
Do the sm@@ iles convince ?
This is a move that has my@@ sti@@ fied Moscow .
Serge@@ i I@@ van@@ ov has long been one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest allies and , like him , served in the Soviet security service , the KGB .
As chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
In a meeting with President Putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was ste@@ pping down at his own request .
But despite the sm@@ iles for the cam@@ er@@ as , few here are convinced - especially now , just before parliamentary elections .
So is this the fall@@ -@@ out from some kind of power struggle ?
No@@ -@@ one knows yet .
But the official claim - that a man once tou@@ ted as a potential president , suddenly wanted to run Russia &apos;s environmental policy - has been met with great s@@ cep@@ ticism .
In remar@@ ks to M@@ r Putin , qu@@ oted on the Kremlin web@@ site , M@@ r I@@ van@@ ov said &quot; it &apos;s true that in early 2012 I asked you , in a conversation , to ent@@ ru@@ st me with this very complicated post , even - you could say - trou@@ ble@@ some post , for four years .
Well , it turns out that I &apos;@@ ve been presidential chief of staff for four years and eight months .
M@@ r I@@ van@@ ov took up the post in December 2011 .
He served previously as a deputy prime minister and def@@ ence minister .
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security service , like M@@ r Putin .
In the late 1990s , when M@@ r Putin was head of the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , which replaced the KGB , M@@ r I@@ van@@ ov was appointed as his deputy .
When M@@ r Putin came to power , he named M@@ r I@@ van@@ ov as one of the five people he trusted most .
It was once thought that M@@ r I@@ van@@ ov might become president of Russia after M@@ r Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term for M@@ r Putin would have been un@@ constitutional .
But that post was taken by another close Putin ally , Dmit@@ ry Medvedev .
M@@ r Putin became prime minister , before returning to the presidency just three-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half years later .

Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ fer@@ ry Cro@@ ssing : Bri@@ dge now connected to Fi@@ fe
The £ 1.@@ 35@@ b@@ n project is now due to be complete by May 2017
Eng@@ ine@@ ers have joined the Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ fer@@ ry Cro@@ ssing &apos;s north dec@@ k and vi@@ ad@@ uc@@ t - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
It is the first of four clo@@ sures between the &quot; dec@@ k fans , &quot; which are now ne@@ aring completion around each of the bridge &apos;s three tow@@ ers .
The bridge section from Fi@@ fe is now 600 met@@ res long and weigh@@ s 30,000 ton@@ nes .
It has 10,000 ton@@ nes of steel and 20,000 ton@@ nes of concrete and 46 stay@@ -@@ c@@ ables .
The £ 1.@@ 35@@ b@@ n project is now due to be complete by May 2017 .
Economy Secretary Ke@@ ith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land on to the bridge .
He said : &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of the Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ fer@@ ry Cro@@ ssing .
We &apos;@@ re all witnessing engineering on a truly ep@@ ic scale on this project , with over 30,000 ton@@ nes of concrete and steel used just to build this part of the bridge .
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge completing the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ uc@@ t and bridge dec@@ k is a delicate operation involving extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit up .
Overall , nearly 7@@ 9 % of the total bridge dec@@ k is now in place , the final section of dec@@ k is having its concrete dec@@ k cast in Ro@@ sy@@ th today , meaning all the dec@@ k is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge .
Michael Martin , For@@ th Cro@@ ssing Bri@@ dge Con@@ struc@@ tors project director said : &quot; The first closure on any bridge project is always a significant milestone .
On this fant@@ astic project , this closure represents leading edge civil engineering .
After inst@@ alling the last road dec@@ k section and connecting it to the expanding North T@@ ower road dec@@ k , we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or land@@ ward - side .
This was done by pulling the northern approach vi@@ ad@@ uc@@ t 700 m@@ illi@@ met@@ res sou@@ th@@ wards .
This was a massive and , at the same time , very delicate operation .
Mas@@ sive because the vi@@ ad@@ uc@@ t is 2@@ 22 met@@ res long , weigh@@ s approximately 6,000 ton@@ nes and had to be pulled up a gra@@ di@@ ent of about 3 % .
De@@ licate because the toler@@ ances the team were working to were tiny - just a few m@@ illi@@ met@@ res either way .
H@@ ap@@ pi@@ ly , it all went very well .
Sim@@ one B@@ iles n@@ ails all-@@ around gold in women &apos;s g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics
For@@ get the pressure .
For@@ get the hy@@ pe .
Sim@@ one B@@ iles is immune to all of it .
D@@ y@@ nam@@ ic on v@@ a@@ ult .
Effor@@ tless on be@@ am .
J@@ aw@@ -@@ dropping on floor .
Bri@@ lli@@ ant all over .
And now , finally , an Olympic champion .
The 19@@ -year-old American g@@ ym@@ n@@ ast soared to the all-@@ around title on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day , putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full display under the Olympic spot@@ light .
Her total of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was well clear of silver me@@ d@@ alist and &quot; Fin@@ al Five &quot; te@@ amm@@ ate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and Russian b@@ ron@@ ze me@@ d@@ alist Ali@@ ya Mu@@ sta@@ fin@@ a .
United States &apos; Sim@@ one B@@ iles perfor@@ ms on the balance be@@ am during the arti@@ stic g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics women &apos;s individual all-@@ around final at the 2016 Sum@@ mer Olympics in Rio de Jan@@ e@@ iro , Brazil , Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day .
B@@ iles became the fourth stra@@ ight American woman to win the all-@@ around title and fifth overall while cem@@ enting her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever .
She burst into te@@ ars when her final total was po@@ sted and her long journey to this moment ended .
The achievement puts her in the same le@@ ague as once-@@ in-@@ a-@@ generation athletes like Michael P@@ helps who have taken their sports to new heights :
B@@ iles has spent the last three years domin@@ ating her sport , winning 15 world champ@@ ion@@ ship me@@ d@@ als - including 10 gold - with rout@@ ines so astoni@@ shing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion M@@ ary L@@ ou Re@@ tton called her &quot; the greatest g@@ ym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;@@ ve ever seen . &quot;
One last test awa@@ ited in Brazil , a contest not so much between B@@ iles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of over@@ sized expectations .
Any@@ thing less than heading back to her family &apos;s home in Spring , Texas , with a f@@ ist@@ ful of gol@@ ds would be seen as a disappointment .
United States &apos; Sim@@ one B@@ iles , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace after winning gold and silver respectively for the arti@@ stic g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics women &apos;s individual all-@@ around final at the 2016 Sum@@ mer Olympics in Rio de Jan@@ e@@ iro , Brazil , Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day , Au@@ g .
B@@ iles earned the first one on Tu@@ es@@ day while serving as the exc@@ lam@@ ation point to reti@@ ring national team coordin@@ ator Mar@@ th@@ a Kar@@ ol@@ y@@ i &apos;s going away party .
While B@@ iles insisted she &apos;s never looked ahead during her long run at the top , that &apos;s not exactly true .
A portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her sign@@ ature tum@@ bling pass - is set to Latin music that would fit right at home in the street right outside the Rio Olympic A@@ ren@@ a .
It &apos;s not a coincidence .
The gir@@ l adopted by her grand@@ parents as a to@@ dd@@ ler and discovered by co@@ ach A@@ im@@ e@@ e Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a field trip to the gy@@ m where Bo@@ or@@ man was co@@ aching has become a force .
She hasn &apos;t lost an all-@@ around competition since the summer of 2013 , a winning stre@@ ak that should go for as long as B@@ iles wants it to .
Though Mu@@ sta@@ fin@@ a took a small lead through two ro@@ tations , it was a mi@@ rage .
Bal@@ ance be@@ am and floor exercise - where B@@ iles is the defending world champion - lay in wait .
She went back in front with a 15@@ .@@ 4@@ 33 on be@@ am - and cap@@ ped it with a 15@@ .@@ 9@@ 33 on floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ gged her g@@ ently as they awa@@ ited the final score - a mere for@@ ma@@ lity - and te@@ ars appeared around B@@ iles &apos; g@@ lit@@ tery red , white and blu@@ e ey@@ el@@ in@@ er when the vision she once wrote in a sc@@ rap@@ book became a reality .
Ra@@ is@@ man &apos;s performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago , when she tied for third but lost the b@@ ron@@ ze to Mu@@ sta@@ fin@@ a on a ti@@ e@@ break@@ er .
This time , the 2@@ 2-@@ year-old team cap@@ tain the Americans call &quot; grand@@ ma &quot; was well ahead .
She ble@@ w k@@ is@@ ses to the crowd after her floor exercise , overcome by a come@@ back that at times seemed in doubt .
As for B@@ iles , the 19@@ -year-old &apos;s viral twe@@ et from earlier this week now carries a whole new meaning :
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; ri@@ ddled with bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves Ph@@ il@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a shooting
Poli@@ ce say a 6-@@ year-old boy has been shot in Ph@@ il@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a , marking the second shooting of a 6-@@ year-old in the city this week .
The child &apos;s grand@@ parents identified him to CB@@ S Ph@@ il@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
The grand@@ parents say Brown suffered multiple gun@@ shot wounds , including in his gro@@ in , le@@ g , arm and ab@@ dom@@ en , but was aw@@ ake when he was trans@@ ported to the hospital .
&quot; He just took a lot , his little body was ri@@ ddled with bul@@ lets , &quot; his grand@@ mother De@@ lo@@ res Mel@@ ende@@ z tells the station .
I just can &apos;t believe it .
The boy is listed in critical condition at a hospital and has under@@ gone several sur@@ ger@@ ies .
Fam@@ ily tells the station he is expected to recover .
He was set to start first grade at a local ele@@ mentary school .
Brown was among four people shot in the German@@ town section .
Al@@ so shot were three men : two 29@@ -@@ year-@@ olds and one 3@@ 2@@ -year old .
One of the 29@@ -year-old men was reported in critical condition ; the other two victims were listed in stable condition , according to CB@@ S Ph@@ il@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a .
The child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29@@ -year-old in critical condition , the station reports .
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investig@@ ating whether any of the wounded men could be a sho@@ o@@ ter .
In@@ v@@ estig@@ ators tells CB@@ S Ph@@ il@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a it appears there was cross@@ fire between multiple gun@@ men .
As@@ sa@@ ult weap@@ on-@@ style sh@@ ell cas@@ ings , trac@@ ed to different assault style weapons , lit@@ tered the scene .
It appears that this was defin@@ itely an ongoing battle .
There were cas@@ ings in the street , on both sides of the side@@ walk .
So it appears that there were multiple armed combatants out here and that they were actively engaged , &quot; Ph@@ il@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a police Cap@@ tain An@@ th@@ ony G@@ in@@ al@@ di told the station .
Mul@@ ti@@ ple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck .
No arre@@ sts have been made and police are reportedly re@@ viewing surveillance video .
Another 6-@@ year-old , a gir@@ l , was hit in her arm by a stra@@ y bul@@ let Tu@@ es@@ day while playing in front of her home in the West O@@ ak Lan@@ e neighborhood .
She is recovering , and police are still searching for a suspect .

And second : This team features three g@@ ym@@ n@@ asts , Sim@@ one B@@ iles , G@@ ab@@ by Dou@@ gl@@ as and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ ri@@ e &quot; Her@@ nan@@ de@@ z , who have been inspiring so many young girls of color .
The make@@ -up of this team , r@@ ounded out by A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , who is Jewish , and Ma@@ dis@@ on Ko@@ ci@@ an , who is Catholic , is making everyone proud .
This team looks , finally , like America .
It also has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and Lat@@ ina female presence at the top of this sport .
For the past four years , the number one female g@@ ym@@ n@@ ast has been African@@ -American .
Last year , Sim@@ one and G@@ ab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
This is powerful .
Last Olympics , G@@ ab@@ by Dou@@ gl@@ as was a surprise Olympic champion , and America che@@ ered .
Now the world has been able to witness the incre@@ di@@ ble perfor@@ man@@ ces of three-@@ time World Cha@@ mp@@ ion Sim@@ one B@@ iles , Dou@@ gl@@ as and Lau@@ ri@@ e Her@@ nan@@ de@@ z delivering the unexpected , yet master@@ ful g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics rout@@ ines .
On Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day , Sim@@ one became the fourth stra@@ ight American to win gold in the women &apos;s individual all-@@ around event .
And te@@ amm@@ ate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man earned silver .
We are witnessing the top of the sport , but it does not look like this at g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics classes across the country .
Sim@@ one , G@@ ab@@ by and Lau@@ ri@@ e all took the same path as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dis@@ on to make the Olympic team .
They are the &quot; Fin@@ al Five &quot; because the next Olympic g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics team will only have four g@@ ym@@ n@@ asts on the team , and this is Mar@@ ta Kar@@ ol@@ y@@ i &apos;s last year co@@ aching .
But the reality is that g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics is an expensive sport , and g@@ ym@@ n@@ asts primarily train in private g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training , facility , travel , uni@@ forms , competition fees , hotel fees ( for the co@@ aches and their g@@ ym@@ n@@ asts and families ) and the list goes on .
Most of these g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics clubs are located in affluent sub@@ urban neighborhoods that can support the business .
These clubs are where the g@@ ym@@ n@@ asts get all of their training , and it &apos;s a costly and long-term commitment for the g@@ ym@@ n@@ asts &apos; families .
A@@ im@@ e@@ e Bo@@ or@@ man , co@@ ach of Sim@@ one B@@ iles , and Mag@@ gi@@ e Han@@ ey , co@@ ach of Lau@@ ri@@ e Her@@ nan@@ de@@ z , have both co@@ ached their athletes since they started in g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics .
We must bring more affordable and accessible g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Sim@@ one , G@@ ab@@ by and Lau@@ ri@@ e .
I founded my g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics foundation 20 years ago .
At my organizations , we have provided free and low-cost g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics , based in Har@@ le@@ m , for over 15@@ ,000 urban youth ( primarily black and H@@ is@@ panic ) and have trained national and international champions .
In September , we will be expanding to De@@ tro@@ it ( my home@@ town ) to provide high quality g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
G@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
This combination provides life-@@ long benefits for good health , success in school and work .
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to take g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics and that is great .
To participate in sport is so important , especially for girls .
This is such an exciting time .
Th@@ an@@ k you Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ ri@@ e , G@@ ab@@ by and Ma@@ dis@@ on for that serious show@@ case of &quot; G@@ ir@@ l Power &quot; in winning the Olympic team gold and for motiv@@ ating so many young girls of all back@@ grounds to begin their path to be healthy , strong and successful young women .
J@@ uni@@ or doctors set to mount further strikes after rejecting Jeremy H@@ unt &apos;s proposal
Minist@@ ers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials , but 58 per cent of the 37@@ ,000 j@@ uni@@ or doctors who took part in a ballot had rejected it .
In July , M@@ r H@@ unt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the N@@ H@@ S was in &quot; no man &apos;s land &quot; and any further delay would be damaging for staff and patients .
The first j@@ uni@@ or doctors are moved onto the new contract , which includes changes to overnight and wee@@ k@@ end working practices to improve care at un@@ soci@@ able hours .
D@@ r El@@ len Mc@@ Court , the BM@@ A &apos;s j@@ uni@@ or doctors &quot; committee chair , said in a statement last night : &quot; J@@ uni@@ or doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract , particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis , and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly . &quot;
With just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract , progress needs to be made and time is running out .
Efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve the dispute through talks have been met with an unwillingness to engage and , at times , de@@ af@@ ening silence from the government .
This is despite a promise from Jeremy H@@ unt just last month that his door is always open .
&quot; Jeremy H@@ unt needs to act now , lift the imposition and address j@@ uni@@ or doctors &quot; concerns .
If he does not then j@@ uni@@ or doctors are clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action .
The last strike at the end of April saw the postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appoin@@ tments as nur@@ ses and consul@@ tants were dra@@ fted in to provide cover for doctors on the pic@@ ket line .
Minist@@ ers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials .
The BM@@ A wants better wee@@ k@@ end pay for the 5@@ 4,000 j@@ uni@@ or doctors who would be subject of the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ tim@@ er , chief executive of N@@ H@@ S Emp@@ loy@@ ers , called on j@@ uni@@ or doctors not to go ahead with any strikes .
M@@ r Mor@@ tim@@ er said : &quot; Industrial action achiev@@ es little or nothing , but places pressure on already stretched teams and services and causes worry , distress and disruption for patients , care@@ rs and their families . &quot;
Over the last two months we have been talking with the J@@ uni@@ or Doc@@ tors Committee and have , along with the Department of Health and others , responded posi@@ tively to their concerns regarding the Gu@@ ar@@ dian Ro@@ le and Wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lowing .
Emp@@ loy@@ ers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment , flexibility in training , additional training for those returning from career breaks , costs of training , mutual recognition of sy@@ l@@ lab@@ us , study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers , Health Education England and the Department of Health were about hon@@ ouring the agreements reached with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
The £ 2-@@ a-@@ day drug that can cut heart attack threat
Th@@ ous@@ ands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £ 2-@@ a-@@ day drug , after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer .
Anti-@@ clo@@ tting drug tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or sl@@ ash@@ es the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease .
The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stro@@ ke or another attack .
N@@ H@@ S watch@@ dog N@@ IC@@ E has advised that it should be given to people for four years , to further reduce the risk of cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular problems .
But now N@@ H@@ S watch@@ dog N@@ IC@@ E has advised that it should be given to people for four years , to further reduce the risk of cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular problems .
Some 14@@ 0@@ ,000 people have a heart attack in England every year , and a quarter of these go on to have another attack or a stro@@ ke .
H@@ ear@@ t attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by the buil@@ d-up of fat@@ ty material in ar@@ tery walls to form a pla@@ que .
If the pla@@ que breaks apart it can cause a blood clo@@ t , blocking blood to the heart causing a heart attack .
And if the clo@@ t dis@@ lo@@ d@@ ges it can travel in the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain , causing a stro@@ ke .
People who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is made by UK firm A@@ stra@@ Z@@ en@@ ec@@ a and sold under the trade name Bri@@ liqu@@ e , reduces this risk by making clo@@ ts less likely .
The draft N@@ IC@@ E guidance , published today , recomm@@ ends that people be given 90 m@@ g of tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or for 12 months , followed by 60@@ m@@ g along with aspir@@ in twice a day for another three years .
Pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or Car@@ o@@ le L@@ ong@@ son , director at the N@@ IC@@ E health technology evaluation cent@@ re , said : &quot; Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments , as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stro@@ ke - often with devastating consequences . &quot;
Fear of a recur@@ rence can have a significant negative impact on a person &apos;s quality of life .
The evidence shows that tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , in combination with aspir@@ in , is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who have already had a heart attack .
In provi@@ sionally recomm@@ ending tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are ple@@ ased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it .
Because information on the efficacy and safety of tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - particularly the risk of ble@@ eding - beyond three years is limited , the draft guidance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that period .
PC culture let vote fraud in Muslim areas flourish
Ex@@ -@@ T@@ ower Ham@@ lets mayor L@@ ut@@ fur R@@ ah@@ man was removed from office last year for corruption , promp@@ ting the government report
A culture of political correc@@ t@@ ness has led to a blind eye being turned to widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities , a devastating government report reveals today .
Ex@@ -@@ C@@ ab@@ inet minister S@@ ir E@@ ric P@@ ick@@ les lam@@ ba@@ sts the police , election watch@@ dogs and town h@@ alls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of &quot; over-@@ sensi@@ tivi@@ ties about ethnicity and religion . &quot;
The former communities secretary , now the anti-corruption ts@@ ar , said the intimid@@ ation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cor@@ d@@ ons outside polling stations to protect frigh@@ tened voters .
He recomm@@ ends that voters should have to take I@@ D to prove who they are when they vote .
Currently , a voter merely has to state their name and address .
The report even suggests putting in@@ deli@@ ble in@@ k on a person &apos;s fing@@ ers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice .
Greater protection should be given to wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blow@@ ers , S@@ ir E@@ ric says .
He calls for the P@@ ress to be given greater access to council papers and decisions taken by un@@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; This is not solely to protect against electoral fraud , but to protect local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it , &quot; he said .
The report was ordered by D@@ ow@@ ning Street in the wake of the T@@ ower Ham@@ lets voting scandal in East London .
Last year a special election court ruled the sitting mayor , L@@ ut@@ fur R@@ ah@@ man , should be removed from office following a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices .
The court found R@@ ah@@ man &quot; cy@@ nically per@@ ver@@ ted &quot; the religious feeling of his Muslim community and sil@@ enced his critics with accusations of racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
R@@ ah@@ man , it was said , &quot; ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of fa@@ ith@@ ful Muslims to vote for him . &quot;
Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of person@@ ation , where a person votes while posing as someone else .
S@@ ir E@@ ric said there was evidence of fraud across the country .
He voic@@ ed particular alarm about post@@ al voting fraud - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have ex@@ er@@ ted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing .
S@@ ir E@@ ric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your I@@ D to prove who you are
His report says : &quot; Evi@@ d@@ ence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities , particularly women and young people , to vote according to the will of the el@@ ders , especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangla@@ de@@ shi background .
&quot; There were concerns that ... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behavi@@ our because of &quot; politically correct &quot; over-@@ sensi@@ tivi@@ ties about ethnicity and religion . &quot;
S@@ ir E@@ ric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including ban@@ ning political activists from handling post@@ al ballot papers to stop &quot; vote har@@ vest@@ ing . &quot;
The report , being considered by Theresa May , also calls for tougher checks on regi@@ stration to prevent the electoral regi@@ ster being used for immigration and benefit fraud .
Consider the options for requiring voters to produce I@@ D before voting .
U@@ se in@@ deli@@ ble in@@ k on a person &apos;s fing@@ ers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice .
Car@@ ry out systematic checks on a person &apos;s nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote .
P@@ ut a three-@@ year limit on requests for an automatic post@@ al vote .
Ban political campa@@ igners and activists from handling completed post@@ al votes and post@@ al vote en@@ velop@@ es .
Gi@@ ve police powers to set up cor@@ d@@ ons around polling stations .
Change the law to make it easier to charge people with intimid@@ ation under the Represent@@ ation of the People Act 198@@ 3 .
Make it illegal to take pic@@ tures in polling stations .
Make it a requirement that only English is to be used in polling stations ( except in Wal@@ es ) .
St@@ reng@@ then training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the boo@@ th alone .
S@@ ir E@@ ric sav@@ ages the Me@@ tro@@ politan Poli@@ ce , saying it is &quot; astoni@@ shing &quot; that no criminal charges were brought after the T@@ ower Ham@@ lets case .
&quot; The election court dis@@ qualified L@@ ut@@ fur R@@ ah@@ man and his agent for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; he said .
He was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of grounds .
He also critici@@ ses the in@@ eff@@ ec@@ tual &quot; tic@@ k-@@ box inspec@@ tions &quot; of town h@@ all electoral regi@@ stration departments .
S@@ ir E@@ ric said : &quot; Last year &apos;s court ruling in T@@ ower Ham@@ lets was a wa@@ ke@@ -up call .
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments , yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation .
C@@ ra@@ zy for K@@ ate &apos;s cyc@@ list loo@@ k@@ alike and other cele@@ b d@@ op@@ pel@@ gang@@ ers of Rio Olymp@@ ians
F@@ ans of the Rio 2016 Olympics this week have gone wild for French cyc@@ list Paul@@ ine Fer@@ ran@@ d-@@ Pre@@ vo@@ t , who has proven an impressive loo@@ k@@ alike for the Du@@ chess of Cam@@ bridge .
But the 24@@ -year-old Olymp@@ ian is far from the only athle@@ te out fighting for gold this summer that bo@@ asts their own celebr@@ ity d@@ op@@ pel@@ g@@ anger - at least not according to social media .
So , in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces crossing our scre@@ ens at the moment , F@@ EM@@ AI@@ L have comp@@ iled a list of Olymp@@ ians who bear more than a passing resemb@@ lance with Hollywood cele@@ bs .
The hun@@ ter and the w@@ olf : U@@ .@@ S. M@@ en &apos;s Ar@@ ch@@ ery Te@@ am member Bra@@ dy E@@ lli@@ son , left , has been compared to Le@@ on@@ ardo Di@@ Cap@@ ri@@ o since he was a k@@ id
Aside from K@@ ate &apos;s d@@ op@@ pel@@ g@@ anger on the cyc@@ ling track , many people online have been quick to point out how a certain arch@@ er could be the twin of A@@ -@@ li@@ ster Le@@ on@@ ardo Di@@ Cap@@ ri@@ o .
U@@ .@@ S. M@@ en &apos;s Ar@@ ch@@ ery Te@@ am member Bra@@ dy E@@ lli@@ son has caused a storm on Twitter after images of him looking e@@ er@@ ily similar to the Wol@@ f of Wall Street star sur@@ faced .
And in fact , the arch@@ er became aware of the social media f@@ ren@@ zy and admitted that he has been hearing that he looks like Le@@ o since he was a k@@ id .
&apos;@@ I personally don &apos;t see a huge resemb@@ lance , maybe be@@ sides the fac@@ ial ha@@ ir , &apos; Bra@@ dy told Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&apos;@@ He is a go@@ od-@@ looking du@@ de so I guess it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &apos; 
One of the most popular compar@@ isons from London 2012 is undoubtedly going to be pointed out even more this year : the striking li@@ ken@@ ess between British long jum@@ per Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and popular actor Ne@@ il Pat@@ ric@@ k Har@@ ris .
Russian g@@ ym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ sta@@ fin@@ a , with her large , ex@@ pressive eyes , has been said to be a dead r@@ inger for Cu@@ ban@@ -American singer Gl@@ oria E@@ ste@@ fan .
And over in the pool , South African sw@@ im@@ mer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been getting compared to G@@ le@@ e star Mat@@ the@@ w Mor@@ ris@@ on for years now .
Chang@@ ing it up : This user reck@@ ons that N@@ athan is an &apos; athle@@ tic version &apos; of the In@@ cep@@ tion actor
Another long-@@ running comparison has been between ten@@ nis star Ra@@ fa@@ el N@@ ad@@ al and actor Jo@@ sh Har@@ t@@ net@@ t who bo@@ ast a similar heavy bro@@ w and li@@ ps .
Sil@@ ver me@@ dal sw@@ im@@ mer Russia &apos;s Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ o@@ va bo@@ asts more than just the same sun@@ k@@ is@@ sed skin and bl@@ on@@ de ha@@ ir as ac@@ t@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ Cor@@ d , while Te@@ am US@@ A &apos;s N@@ athan A@@ dri@@ an has been said by fans to resemble an &apos; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gor@@ g@@ on Lev@@ it@@ t . &apos; 
T@@ ough women : S@@ oc@@ cer star Hope Sol@@ o , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter ac@@ t@@ ress J@@ en@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have similar face sha@@ pes and eyes
Not the only one : One Twitter user was very ple@@ ased that others also saw the simil@@ ari@@ ti@@ est
F@@ lo@@ ating a theory : According to this user , perhaps there is a reason behind the pa@@ ir &apos;s similar looks
One Twitter user took to the site recently to declare her happiness that &apos; the rest of the inter@@ net thinks that Hope Sol@@ o and J@@ en@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are actually identical . &apos; 
Indeed , the US@@ A soccer star and the D@@ ex@@ ter ac@@ t@@ ress share incre@@ di@@ bly similar face sha@@ pes and eyes .
Other popular compar@@ isons have included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh-@@ J@@ en@@ nings and her sm@@ ile that is near-@@ identical to that of ac@@ t@@ ress La@@ ura L@@ in@@ ney , as well as gold me@@ d@@ al-@@ winning g@@ ym@@ n@@ ast G@@ ab@@ by Dou@@ gl@@ as , who bo@@ asts her own beau@@ ti@@ fully broad sm@@ ile that matches that of B@@ ring It On star G@@ ab@@ ri@@ el@@ le Union .

Too exc@@ ited , went out like st@@ in@@ k , died like a pi@@ g .

Chinese sw@@ im@@ mer A@@ i Y@@ an@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second le@@ g of the re@@ lay in 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 7@@ 9 - 1.@@ 6@@ 1 secon@@ ds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor R@@ uck , allowing the Can@@ adi@@ ans to close the gap on China .
Vie@@ w@@ ers across Canada were quick to react online after being shocked by the tone and the language used
Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ lan@@ e t@@ wee@@ ted , &quot; D@@ id the C@@ BC announ@@ cer just say the 14@@ -year-old sw@@ im@@ mer from China &apos; died like a pi@@ g &apos; &quot; ? ? ? ?

A@@ i Y@@ an@@ han of China in the Women &apos;s 4 x 200@@ m Fre@@ est@@ y@@ le Rel@@ ay Fin@@ al was described as : &apos; That little 14@@ -year-old from China dropped the ball , baby . &apos;

You represent the C@@ BC and Canada and make us all sound like a bun@@ ch of rac@@ ists . # disgu@@ sted .
Soon after , Scot@@ t Rus@@ sel who was hosting C@@ BC &apos;s broadcast apologi@@ zed on-@@ air for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comment , saying : &apos; We apologi@@ ze the comment on a swi@@ m performance made it to air . &apos;

C@@ BC ended up apologi@@ zing more than 90 times to people who had t@@ wee@@ ted in response to the re@@ mark
F@@ el@@ low comment@@ ator , Scot@@ t Rus@@ sel , had to make an apo@@ logy on Mac@@ Donald &apos;s behalf
C@@ BC then cop@@ ied and pa@@ sted their apo@@ logy to more than 90 other tw@@ it@@ ter users who complained about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
The network was also quick to apologi@@ ze and released a statement .
We sinc@@ e@@ rely regret that these statements were made , and that they were allowed to go to air .
We moved quickly last night to apologi@@ ze to our view@@ ers on-@@ air and to our followers on Social media .
To be clear , B@@ y@@ ron &apos;s comments were related to the sw@@ im@@ mer &apos;s performance , not to her as an individual .
That said , they were in@@ appropriate and an unfortunate choice of words and B@@ y@@ ron is very sor@@ ry for what he said .
On Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day after@@ no@@ on , Mac@@ Donald apologi@@ zed on-@@ air and attempted to qualify his re@@ mark by stating he didn &apos;t mean for it to be con@@ str@@ u@@ ed as a personal attack .
&apos;@@ I would like to take a moment to apologi@@ ze for a comment that I made last night after the women &apos;s re@@ lay , &apos; he said on C@@ BC &apos;s Olympic broadcast . &apos;

Pri@@ mark sh@@ op@@ per outra@@ ged at woman who bra@@ z@@ enly tried on under@@ wear in the middle of the shop
Sh@@ op@@ p@@ ers didn &apos;t know where to look when a woman stri@@ pped off to try on k@@ nic@@ kers on the shop floor in the middle of a Pri@@ mark .
To make it even worse , she sized up how she looked in them , pe@@ eled them off and put them back on the shel@@ f .
She carried on b@@ row@@ sing and eventually tried on four pa@@ irs of under@@ wear at the store in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Pl@@ ace shopping cent@@ re , Fol@@ ke@@ stone .
The Pri@@ mark store in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Pl@@ ace shopping cent@@ re , Fol@@ ke@@ stone , where the woman tried on k@@ nic@@ kers before putting them back on the shel@@ f
A mo@@ ther@@ -of-@@ two , J@@ en@@ ny D@@ avi@@ d@@ son , who was in the shop at the time , said after trying on the under@@ wear the myster@@ y woman &apos; got d@@ ressed again and wal@@ ked out of the store without buying anything . &apos; 
She said : &apos; People couldn &apos;t believe what they were seeing . &apos; 
Stan@@ ding in the middle of the shop floor , she took a pa@@ ir of k@@ nic@@ kers from the display , stri@@ pped off her own tigh@@ ts and p@@ ants and put them on .
&apos;@@ She didn &apos;t try to find anywhere discre@@ et to do it - she just stood there , bold as bra@@ ss . &apos; 
&apos;@@ Everyone was star@@ ing as she took the k@@ nic@@ kers off again and obviously didn &apos;t like them because she put them back on the shel@@ f . &apos; 
She did the same with three more pa@@ irs before finally deciding there was nothing she liked and she got d@@ ressed again and wal@@ ked out .
&apos;@@ She didn &apos;t seem to care who was watching - or think about the person who would eventually buy the k@@ nic@@ kers she &apos;@@ d been trying on . &apos; 
M@@ s D@@ avi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in the K@@ ent town , said : &apos; How disgu@@ sting to think someone is going to take home k@@ nic@@ kers that another person has been wearing and they haven &apos;t been clean@@ ed . &apos; 
The incident happened on Tu@@ es@@ day after@@ no@@ on .
M@@ s D@@ avi@@ d@@ son added : &apos; I gather the staff apparently tried to remove the gar@@ ments from sale after she had left - which is just as well . &apos; 
&apos;@@ I &apos;@@ d hate to get home with a new pa@@ ir of k@@ nic@@ kers and find another woman had put them on and taken them off again , and they had@@ n &apos;t been w@@ ashed . &apos; 
A Pri@@ mark spokes@@ man said : &apos; Pri@@ mark is aware of an incident which took place in our Fol@@ ke@@ stone store on Tu@@ es@@ day August 9 . &apos; 
All the product in question has been removed from sale .
How to defend yourself from gun attacks using K@@ ra@@ v M@@ aga
It &apos;s a dangerous world out there , but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ ma@@ il@@ .@@ com might help make it a little safer for you .
We spoke to R@@ h@@ on M@@ iz@@ rac@@ hi , New Yor@@ k-@@ based grand@@ master of the K@@ ra@@ v M@@ aga Feder@@ ation , to find out how to deal with gun@@ -@@ to@@ ting m@@ ugg@@ ers at close range .
Whether you &apos;@@ re approach@@ ed from in front or behind , this video will show you how to turn the tables on your m@@ ug@@ ger .
If approach@@ ed from behind , M@@ iz@@ rac@@ hi says , the first thing to do is turn around , so that you can see your att@@ ack@@ er and &apos; clear the line of fire &apos; .
You then grasp the gun between your fore@@ arm and shoul@@ der before hitting them in the face with your free el@@ bo@@ w .
A k@@ ne@@ e to the gro@@ in follows , and while the att@@ ack@@ er doub@@ les up in pain , you t@@ wi@@ st the gun from his hands , sm@@ ack him in the face with the barrel and back up , keeping the weapon trained on him .
For gun@@ men approaching from the front , it &apos;s a similar techni@@ que - get your body out of the line of fire , grab the gun and t@@ wi@@ st it around so the vil@@ lain can &apos;t fire .
At the same time , put weight on the gun and pun@@ ch the att@@ ack@@ er in the ch@@ est , then t@@ wi@@ st the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him .
S@@ ounds tric@@ ky ?
Ch@@ ec@@ k the video to see exactly how M@@ iz@@ rac@@ hi does it .
But remember that the safe@@ st way out of any m@@ ug@@ ging - if you &apos;@@ re not a K@@ ra@@ v M@@ aga grand@@ master - is to hand over your cash .
Fam@@ ily of y@@ ob@@ s destroyed Sal@@ t@@ ash , Cor@@ n@@ wall council house ahead of ev@@ ic@@ tion
A family of y@@ ob@@ s left their council house with £ 50,000 worth of damage after they were ev@@ ic@@ ted for terror@@ ising their neighb@@ ours .
T@@ anya S@@ kel@@ don and her partner Sha@@ un Tre@@ b@@ il@@ co@@ ck have been k@@ icked out of the property in Sal@@ t@@ ash , Cor@@ n@@ wall , after a long list of complaints against them .
After they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from the property , shocked housing associations officers found the property in a state of dis@@ repair .
The walls were left with g@@ aping holes , flo@@ or@@ boards were ri@@ pped up , rub@@ b@@ ish was stre@@ w@@ n over the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was dau@@ bed on the walls .
The family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private ac@@ com@@ o@@ dation
Don@@ n@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , housing manag@@ er at Cor@@ n@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she feared it might be beyond saving .
She said : &apos; It &apos;s been an absolute nightmare for people down here and I don &apos;t think people should have to live like that .
There are a lot of things to weigh up because this property will probably be known by the not-@@ so-@@ nice element of Cor@@ n@@ wall .
This family are notorious and their name is notorious .
The couple had three sons who lived at the property inter@@ mit@@ t@@ ently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with ba@@ se@@ ball b@@ ats , intimid@@ ating nearby residents , drug use , drug dealing and excessive shou@@ ting , arguing and swe@@ aring .
S@@ kel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the ten@@ ancy , was given an anti@@ social behavi@@ our order in June .
Old rub@@ b@@ ish was found in a number of the rooms of the house , which may be demo@@ li@@ shed
F@@ lo@@ or boards had been pulled up in the property , from which drugs had been dealt in the past
Neigh@@ b@@ ours say they were seen fighting in the street and police were regularly called
Cor@@ n@@ wall H@@ ousing ev@@ ic@@ ted her and her partner force@@ fully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily .
The ev@@ ic@@ tion was ha@@ iled by reli@@ ev@@ ed neighb@@ ours who said their lives had been made a living hell .
One said : &apos; They didn &apos;t care about any@@ body . &apos; 
We lived next to them for 20 years and it &apos;s always been bad .
The amount of times we &apos;@@ ve seen the police down here is un@@ believ@@ able .
&apos;@@ This morning , we couldn &apos;t sleep . &apos; 
We got up because it was so quiet here - we &apos;@@ re not used to that !
It &apos;s going to be lo@@ vely now that they &apos;@@ re finally gone .
Adam F@@ itz@@ pat@@ ric@@ k , Cor@@ n@@ wall H@@ ousing &apos;s neighb@@ our@@ hood enforcement manag@@ er , said the family failed to cooperate with the local authority .
The family have lived in the house for 20 years , with police regularly called to the property
Ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish and old to@@ ys have been thrown down the over@@ grown side of the council house
He added : &apos; It is a shame that the ten@@ ant failed to accept any responsibility for the behavi@@ our of her and her family as ev@@ ic@@ tion is always the last course of action that Cor@@ n@@ wall H@@ ousing considers .
This was a very difficult case as the behavi@@ our was extreme and their actions must have been terri@@ fying for her neighb@@ ours to witness .
I appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team , D@@ ev@@ on and Cor@@ n@@ wall Poli@@ ce and members of the community who bra@@ vely came forward to give us information .
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighb@@ ours and sen@@ ds out a message that anti@@ social behavi@@ our will not be toler@@ ated .
M@@ r F@@ itz@@ pat@@ ric@@ k said that the three sons had all lived at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20@@ s .
A dirty m@@ att@@ ress left on the floor of one of the be@@ dro@@ oms in the house after the ev@@ ic@@ tion
H@@ ousing workers will now have to clear away the pil@@ es of rub@@ b@@ ish which sur@@ round the house
In 2014 , police ra@@ ided the property and found more than 70@@ g in cann@@ ab@@ is as well as sc@@ ales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ ali@@ a and £ 1,@@ 700 in cash .
S@@ kel@@ don was fin@@ ed after p@@ leading guilty to possession of a C@@ l@@ ass B drug with intent to supply .
She claimed the money was going towards a head@@ stone for her son , Lee S@@ kel@@ don , who died in a car crash in 2013 .
After being made home@@ less , it is understood that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in private housing in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
The walls of many of the house &apos;s rooms had gra@@ ff@@ iti scra@@ w@@ led across them .
Poli@@ ce say they will seek to ev@@ ic@@ t ten@@ ants who fl@@ out the rules of their ten@@ an@@ cies
Angela C@@ row , of D@@ ev@@ on and Cor@@ n@@ wall Poli@@ ce , said the ev@@ ic@@ tion sent a clear warning to other ten@@ ants who continue to fl@@ out the rules .
&apos;@@ This sen@@ ds out to those who feel that they can behave without rec@@ ri@@ min@@ ation , as well as those bli@@ gh@@ ted by such behavi@@ our , &apos; she said .
Criminal and anti@@ social behavi@@ our will never be toler@@ ated by D@@ ev@@ on and Cor@@ n@@ wall Poli@@ ce , who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
Re@@ id says Clinton will stick with Gar@@ land as Supreme Court nominee if elected
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Re@@ id says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nom@@ inate Jud@@ ge Mer@@ ric@@ k Gar@@ land to the Supreme Court if she is elected president .
Senate Republicans have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confir@@ mation since President Barack Obama nom@@ inated him in March .
Senate Maj@@ ority Leader Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ ne@@ ll says the next president will choose the person to replace late Supreme Court Justice An@@ ton@@ in S@@ cali@@ a .
Re@@ id said on a conference call Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day that he is predicting Clinton will pick Gar@@ land &quot; with some degree of credibility . &quot;
A spokes@@ woman for Re@@ id later said he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and was specul@@ ating .
He praised Gar@@ land and said Clinton &apos;s team would not want to &quot; rock the boat &quot; with a new pick .
Gar@@ land is the chief judge for the U@@ .@@ S. Court of Ap@@ pe@@ als for the Dist@@ ric@@ t of Columbia C@@ ir@@ cu@@ it .
Re@@ id said Republicans who are blocking Gar@@ land &apos;s nomination are &quot; mini@@ ons &quot; and &quot; enab@@ lers &quot; of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump .
He said Trump is un@@ fit for office .

French court rejects bid to demo@@ lish shops at J@@ ung@@ le refugee camp
A French court has rejected a bid by Cal@@ a@@ is authorities to demo@@ lish dozens of make@@ shift shops and restaurants in the J@@ ung@@ le camp where thousands of refugees are living .
At a court hearing this week , Cal@@ a@@ is authorities had argued the state should be able to k@@ no@@ ck down a total of 72 make@@ shift shops where people inside the camp sell goods , from cigare@@ tt@@ es to energy drin@@ ks , offer hair@@ cuts , or sell te@@ a for 50 cents ( 40@@ p ) or basic me@@ als for a few euros in make@@ shift restaurants .
The Cal@@ a@@ is pre@@ f@@ ect &apos;s office argued the places should be demo@@ li@@ shed because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax , and because they carried fire and sanitation risks .
Human@@ itarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vital , saying the free me@@ als offered by a state-@@ backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp .
They argued the make@@ shift shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free me@@ als to those in need .
A L@@ ille court ruled there was no legal basis for exp@@ el@@ ling the people running the 72 make@@ shift shops , but said the Cal@@ a@@ is pre@@ f@@ ect &apos;s concerns &quot; were totally understandable . &quot;
The judge , Jean-@@ François M@@ oll@@ a , said the gro@@ cer@@ ies , c@@ af@@ es and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people that &quot; live in extremely precarious conditions . &quot;
He said the sp@@ aces provided calm meeting points between refugees and volunte@@ ers .
One of the places that had been under threat from demo@@ li@@ tion was the camp &apos;s J@@ ung@@ le Bo@@ ok Ki@@ ds &quot; C@@ af@@ e which is run not-@@ for-profit and provides 200 me@@ als a day , English and French classes , and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
More than 170@@ ,000 people have signed a petition to protect the kids &quot; c@@ af@@ e .
A letter sent to the Gu@@ ar@@ dian said its closure &quot; would be a catastrophe for these children , some of whom are as young as eight . &quot;
Two ch@@ arities , Hel@@ p Refugees and L &apos;@@ Au@@ ber@@ ge des Mig@@ rants , on Fri@@ day estimated that numbers in the J@@ ung@@ le camp have risen to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest ever - after a steep increase in arri@@ vals during the summer .
&quot; This 5,000@@ -@@ y@@ uan subsidy solved the problem of my pressing need for money . &quot;
Zhou F@@ en , a gir@@ l who was registered in the pover@@ ty-@@ stric@@ ken f@@ ile of Mi@@ p@@ o Vill@@ age , Chang@@ le T@@ own , Hu@@ ay@@ uan Coun@@ ty , received the letter of admission from University of South China .
When she was worried about the tu@@ ition , the coun@@ ty committee of the Communist Y@@ outh League offered she a 5000@@ -@@ y@@ uan subsidy on August 9 .
Recently , the related coun@@ ty government department has provided a subsidy total@@ ed 2.@@ 8@@ 38 million y@@ uan to over 6@@ 90 pover@@ ty-@@ stric@@ ken college students .
It also organized social fun@@ d-@@ raising for students who are extremely poor in financial status to help them accomplish their study .
This year , Hu@@ ay@@ uan Coun@@ ty integrated more than RMB 18@@ .5 million of educational funds and self-@@ raised more than RMB 2.5 million , which will be inj@@ ected into the real-@@ name bank accounts of the corresponding students .
&quot; I thought my el@@ der brother and I cannot afford the college study after my father passed away . It never occurred to me before the coun@@ ty government helped us so timely . &quot; She said gr@@ ate@@ fully .
As of August 8 , Hu@@ ay@@ uan Coun@@ ty had raised more than 21 million y@@ uan of various relief funds this first half year for 13@@ ,@@ 140 pover@@ ty-@@ stric@@ ken students .
All pover@@ ty-@@ stric@@ ken students of the coun@@ ty that should be supported have been supported financially .
According to the repor@@ ter on the scene , a large contain@@ er tr@@ uck shifted to the fast lan@@ e with the command of a traffic poli@@ cem@@ an . Its contain@@ er box fell down onto the green road , making a 2 c@@ m deep p@@ it on the road .
According to the Xin@@ hu@@ a news agency , Australia &apos;s New South Wal@@ es government announced on the 11@@ th day of the month that it will spend 200 million Australian dollars ( about 15@@ 4 million US dollars ) to launch the biggest re@@ no@@ vation on the famous Sy@@ d@@ ney Oper@@ a House since its establishment .
The New South Wal@@ es government said the re@@ no@@ vation would not change the sh@@ ell shape of the oper@@ a house .
The Sy@@ d@@ ney Oper@@ a House is one of Sy@@ d@@ ney &apos;s landmark buildings , designed by Danish archit@@ ect Jor@@ n U@@ t@@ z@@ on and built in 1973 . It wel@@ comes about 8 million visit@@ ors each year .
R@@ ory Jeff@@ es , general manag@@ er of the Sy@@ d@@ ney Sy@@ mp@@ h@@ ony Or@@ che@@ str@@ a , believes that the Sy@@ d@@ ney Oper@@ a House will make a &quot; turn@@ around &quot; via this re@@ no@@ vation and become one of the world &apos;s concer@@ ts with the best sound effects .
Non-@@ permanent residents who have lived in Beijing for more than six months and have a stable and legal employment or accommodation or conditions for continuous schooling in Beijing can apply for a resid@@ ence permit .
Recently , the launch of implementation details of &quot; Re@@ sid@@ ence Per@@ mit Provi@@ sional Regul@@ ations &quot; indicates that the &quot; temporary resid@@ ence permit &quot; will be upgra@@ ded to &quot; resid@@ ence permit &quot; .
A responsible person of the relevant department said that the transition from the &quot; temporary resid@@ ence permit &quot; to &quot; resid@@ ence permit &quot; means that Beijing will shift its administration for non-@@ permanent residents from the &quot; management &quot; to multi-@@ direc@@ tional services .
Today , a repor@@ ter learned from the State Administration of Ta@@ xation ( SA@@ T ) that as of the end of June this year , the tax authorities at all levels have announced a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 70 illegal &quot; black@@ list &quot; cases .
It is understood that in July 2014 , SA@@ T took the first step in the central government departments to issue an Information Dis@@ closure Me@@ th@@ ods For Major Tax Viol@@ ations along with the Tax Credit Management Ap@@ pro@@ ach .
In addition to the illegal facts , legal basis , the handling and punishment of these cases , the basic information of the illegal parties and the relevant intermedi@@ aries will be included in the &quot; black@@ list &quot; exposure .
Qu@@ ality inspec@@ tion , treasury , customs and other government departments also take relevant discipl@@ inary measures against the &quot; black@@ list &quot; parties .
&quot; The credit repair mechanism is an important milestone in the construction of the tax credit system and even the credit system of the whole society , which indicates that the construction of our social credit system is becoming more and more mature . &quot;
&quot; Environmental problems are embodied by the atmosphere , water and soil pollution , but the root still lies in the mode of production and living . &quot;
For example , the land development ratio of Ji@@ ang@@ s@@ u Prov@@ ince was up to 21 % in 2015 , ranking top among all provinces and autonomous regions of China .
Therefore , the problem of high pollution , heavy energy consumption and land occupation has not been fundamentally addressed in the transformation of production and life styles .
On the one hand , Ji@@ ang@@ s@@ u t@@ ops in the whole country from the perspective of the establishment achievement of ecological environment of all levels and classes . But on the other hand , the resource and environment pressure is heavy .
To soli@@ dly promote the ecological environment protection and governance , we need to fundamentally promote the transformation of production and lifestyle and promote the transformation of people &apos;s live@@ lihood from the perspective of ecological civilization construction .

Since last year , Gu@@ o@@ dian Group has exported a total of 16@@ 3 sets of wind power projects from Li@@ any@@ ung@@ ang Por@@ t to South Africa .
The third party company ( non-@@ Chinese company ) commis@@ sioned by the Olympic Organiz@@ ing Committee is located in the Sa@@ o Paul@@ o state , Brazil , about 75 kilometers away from the city of Sa@@ o Paul@@ o .
To urge the manufacturers to finish the production AS@@ A@@ P , the Chinese Con@@ sul@@ ate General in Sa@@ o Paul@@ o sent speci@@ all@@ y-@@ as@@ signed persons to the manufactu@@ rer for in-@@ depth work .
After over@@ time work of 30 hours , the manufactu@@ rer finally completed the Chinese flag production and loaded for transportation . The task was finished 4-@@ 5 working days in advance .
It is reported that the flag@@ s are expected to arrive in Rio on the 11@@ th . Then the Olympic Organiz@@ ing Committee will send the flag@@ s to various Olympic ven@@ ues after receiving the flag . The whole process will be under the supervision of the Chinese embassy in Brazil .
( This newspaper ) On the 10@@ th day of the month , the N@@ ant@@ ong Mun@@ ici@@ pal Government held a series of cooperation activities at the Shanghai International Convention Center . More than 180 Shanghai enterprises were invited to participate . More than 20 Hu@@ -@@ T@@ ong industry doc@@ king projects worth at least RMB 100 million saw on-@@ site signing .
The 20 projects with simultaneous signing have a total investment of RMB 8.@@ 0@@ 63 billion , involving new energy , new materials , modern services and other industries .
Q@@ ing@@ da@@ o is China &apos;s 12@@ th and also Sh@@ and@@ ong &apos;s first trial city to use and trade emissions .
On the 11@@ th day of the month , many companies came to the Q@@ ing@@ da@@ o Mun@@ ici@@ pal E@@ missions Tra@@ ding Center to submit emissions subscri@@ ption . After acceptance , they shall pay fees .
The upcoming first single transaction also indicates that Q@@ ing@@ da@@ o emissions trading pilot officially k@@ icked off . It will also be the first emissions trading in Sh@@ and@@ ong and the first c@@ ity-@@ level emissions trading in China .
In the morning of 11@@ th day of the month , Zha@@ o X@@ i@@ up@@ ing , the General Man@@ ager of Q@@ ing@@ da@@ o S@@ hu@@ ang@@ ta@@ o F@@ ine Ch@@ em@@ ical ( Group ) C@@ o . , L@@ t@@ d@@ . came to the trading center to submit emissions subscri@@ ption .
Its plant in the old urban area of Q@@ ing@@ da@@ o came to a full halt and was moved to the new plant in P@@ ing@@ d@@ u due to environmental reason .
After Zha@@ o X@@ i@@ up@@ ing submitted the application form and the construction project environmental impact report , etc . , Q@@ ing@@ da@@ o Mun@@ ici@@ pal E@@ missions Reserve and Tra@@ ding Service Center began to review the application materials .
According to the collection standard determined by Q@@ ing@@ da@@ o price bu@@ reau and financial sector , the estimated initial emission fee is about 6@@ 4@@ 1,@@ 200 y@@ uan . The working staff will finish review within 7 working days .
The upcoming first single transaction also indicates that Q@@ ing@@ da@@ o emissions trading pilot will officially k@@ ick off . It will also be the first emissions trading in Sh@@ and@@ ong and the first c@@ ity-@@ level emissions trading in China .
According to Zha@@ o X@@ i@@ up@@ ing , up to RMB 400 million has been invested in the current environmental protection . Such investment has a great impact on the enterprise management philosophy and social benefits and also opened up a space for the enterprise innovation management .
On the same day , Q@@ ing@@ da@@ o S@@ F@@ -@@ X@@ C@@ -@@ Z@@ Z Co@@ ach Com@@ pon@@ ent C@@ o . , L@@ t@@ d@@ . also came to purchase emission rights for its project with an annual output of 4,@@ 200 interior acc@@ ess@@ ories of high-speed rail and C@@ R@@ H .
The project is a mechan@@ ical processing enterprise . Its initial emission rate for the chemical ox@@ y@@ gen demand ( CO@@ D ) and am@@ mon@@ ia ( N@@ O@@ X ) are 0.@@ 5@@ 14 tons / year and 0.0@@ 52 tons / year , respectively .
The paid use and trading of Air Pol@@ lu@@ tant E@@ mission Per@@ mits cover the city &apos;s key industrial enterprises for the production and supply of electricity and heat .
On January 1 , 2016 , the current pollu@@ tant dis@@ char@@ ging unit which obtained environmental impact assessment shall be exemp@@ t from expenditure of compensated use .
The ob@@ taining of compensated emission right is not equal to the ob@@ taining of illegal dis@@ charge , so companies cannot dis@@ charge pollu@@ tants at will .
H@@ an H@@ ong@@ yan , deputy director of Q@@ ing@@ da@@ o Environmental Protection Bu@@ reau , introduc@@ es that companies of illegal and excessive se@@ wage must be punished in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations . Il@@ legal enterprises cannot be allowed to circum@@ vent punishment via purchasing emission rights .
In other words , we need to crac@@ k down on environmental violations through legal means and severely punish the enterprises &apos; over standard dis@@ charge behaviors , so as to protect the environment and public health .
Now for their own interests , enterprises have raised their enthusiasm of pollution control , cher@@ ished limited emissions and reduced emissions of pollu@@ tants .
With the economic interests drive , to reduce pollu@@ tants &apos; dis@@ charge has shifted from the government &apos;s mandatory behavior into a conscious market behavior , so as to truly protect the environment , nature and public health .
E@@ mission right , also known as &quot; dumping right &quot; , means the right to dis@@ charge pollu@@ tants . It ref@@ ers to the right for emit@@ ters to dis@@ charge pollu@@ tants to the environment in line with the law within the quota as@@ signed by the government .
This right is essentially the right of the emit@@ ters to occupy , use and benefit from environmental capacity resources .
Next , under the premise that the total dis@@ charge of pollu@@ tants does not exceed the total allow@@ able emission volume , the internal resources of pollution began to swap dis@@ charge capacities via currency exchange .
Since the proposition of emissions trading by American economist D@@ yers in 1968 , it has been applied by the United States of America to the management of atmo@@ spheric and river pollution sources since the 1970s .
Since its pilot in China in 2007 , it has been applied to 14 provinces ( autonomous regions and munici@@ p@@ alities ) including Z@@ he@@ jiang and Ji@@ ang@@ s@@ u .
According to the Ministry of Defense of Russia , in order to assist the air attack of the six strategic bombers on the &quot; Islamic State &quot; target in Syria , a number of Russian fighters lifted from the Syrian Mah@@ mir Air Force base to provide support .
On February 22 this year , the United States and Russia reached a ceasefire agreement on the Syrian conflict . The ceasefire agreement will be implemented since February 27 .
Under the agreement , the ceasefire does not include a military strike against terrorist organizations including &quot; Islamic State &quot; and &quot; Sal@@ vation Front &quot; , which were identified by the United N@@ ation Security Council .
Russia will continue to build the relevant military infrastructure in the base and the living conditions of the Russian soldiers will be protected cor@@ respond@@ ingly .
He also said that if the extremist forces were not hit , these forces will be extended to Russia .
Although Russia and the West did not reach an agreement on the cooperation against the extremist forces of Syria , Russia would strengthen cooperation with Syria , Iran and Iraq in this regard .
In September 2015 , Russia , at the inv@@ itation of the Syrian government , began a military strike against Syrian extremist forces .
On March 15 this year , Russia &apos;s major military forces began to ev@@ acu@@ ate , but the Russian side promised to continue to retain the military base in He@@ im@@ i M@@ im@@ i and the naval base in Tar@@ tus .

Today , 100,000 people on average visit Z@@ hu@@ sh@@ an each year , bringing a variety of ideas or seeking inner peace .
In fact , the relationship between the village and the city should compan@@ ion@@ ship with , just like mother and child . No matter strong or weak . There is no need for any party to be governed by the other party . Such a relationship is warm .
There is no fixed pattern of rural development , but it is quite difficult to just rely on spon@@ taneous rural changes . One of the most important changes is to let the right people go to villages .
Shanghai S@@ ong@@ jiang Dist@@ ric@@ t Tra@@ ffic Control Department recently used electronic police to monitor whether the driver plays mobile phone while driving . As a result , more than 30 cases were detec@@ ted in a week .
With the popularity of smart phones , mobile phones become more and more fun@@ ny . We@@ Ch@@ at , micro@@ blog@@ ging and even games , shopping on Ta@@ ob@@ ao have become normal . It seems that many people cannot leave the phone for a moment , and cannot stop even when driving .
According to &quot; Road Tra@@ ffic Sa@@ fe@@ ty Act &quot; , mobile phones playing are banned and defined as &quot; behavior preventing safe driving &quot; .
Unfortunately , due to some reasons such as the large number of illegal cases and difficulty in ob@@ taining eviden@@ ces , those people have never been punished and make the laws become a kind of dec@@ oration .
If the traffic control department can be determined to declare war to the mobile phone playing behavior while driving and normali@@ ze such measures , such illegal behaviors will surely be cur@@ bed .
The public security organ shall be strict with household regi@@ stration management by gradually establishing electronic and paper fil@@ es for people without H@@ uk@@ ou ( household regi@@ stration ) and ensure the comple@@ ten@@ ess and validity .
The public security organ shall promptly no@@ tify the relevant departments of the regi@@ stration of people without H@@ uk@@ ou .
The policy measures that are inconsistent with the idea of this implementation will receive a centralized clean@@ up . They should be correc@@ ted and aboli@@ shed if necessary .
In the collective greenhouse of D@@ ong@@ lin village of Ta@@ ic@@ ang City , the 4@@ 8@@ -year-old W@@ ang X@@ u@@ ef@@ en is leading workers to pe@@ ar sp@@ ray pestici@@ des on pe@@ ar trees .
There are 150 ac@@ res of or@@ char@@ ds and more than 10 species , but only 12 workers plus a technical engineer are ok .
Last year , the income was a total of RMB 50,000 . I cannot earn so many if i work in the factory because of such age .
Last year , the income of D@@ ong@@ lin village reached RMB 22 million , of which total agricultural income accounted for nearly a half .
According to S@@ u Q@@ i@@ f@@ ang , the village secretary , per capita land cultiv@@ ation area increases each year . 50 m@@ u ( a unit of area , one &quot; m@@ u &quot; = 0.0@@ 6@@ 67 hec@@ ta@@ res ) in the beginning and over 100 m@@ u now . The revenue per m@@ u increases every year and the income of professional farmers also have room for growth every year .
With shares quanti@@ fying to each vill@@ ager , the highlight of the rural collective economic reform is to be clear about the property rights of rural collective management and exploring political and economic separation .
In July 2015 , on An@@ zh@@ en Street of W@@ u@@ x@@ i X@@ i@@ sh@@ an Dist@@ ric@@ t , 14 rural economic cooperation organizations worked with the village committee to implement &quot; sub-@@ account management &quot; . The village committee implemented rural public affairs management while the cooperative organizations were mainly engaged in business .
With two accounts for two institutions , this can prevent the village cad@@ res from participating in collective asset management corruption .
Z@@ hu Ba@@ oping , deputy director of the Ji@@ ang@@ s@@ u Prov@@ in@@ cial Agriculture Committee , said that the next step of Ji@@ ang@@ s@@ u government is to continue to promote the reform of community cooperation system , encourage farmers to jointly develop and establish a vill@@ age-@@ level democratic power operation mechanism .
According to Z@@ hu Ba@@ oping , they should further move forward the reform , engage in community shares cooperation , quanti@@ fy the assets to members , fix it to farmers and produce clear property rights .
Through the Internet + , we shall provide farmers with the rights to know , participate in decision-making and democratic management and turn such rights into standar@@ di@@ zed mechanism of cooperation .
At present , the new collective economy in southern Ji@@ ang@@ s@@ u village mainly consists of four development mo@@ des , including asset le@@ asing , enterprise stock , agricultural development and joint development .
It is understood that overseas exhi@@ bi@@ tions have become important platform for the &quot; Belt and Road Initiative &quot; development .

In the ev@@ ening of the 11@@ th day of the month , just in front of this new TV set , the Z@@ hang Don@@ gh@@ ong couple and their dozens of relatives and friends have witnessed the magic process for the couple &apos;s daughter to catch up and reverse from almost being eliminated in the pre@@ li@@ min@@ aries to almost winning .
At the game , Z@@ hang Bin@@ bin was ranked in the middle and lower reaches and it seemed she was still quite far away from the final .
But her parents and friends did not give up , kept watching the live and saw other players finish the game . Z@@ hang Bin@@ bin raised her ranks all the way and finally came to the final . At this time , a burst of che@@ ers broke out in her home .
In the final , Z@@ hang Bin@@ bin also started from lagging behind and shot more st@@ ably and won the silver me@@ dal with just 0.2 rings behind the champion .
This year , the 2@@ 7-@@ year-old Z@@ hang Bin@@ bin , in the 16@@ -year shooting career , has actually missed the silver me@@ dal for several times .
According to her mother Z@@ hang Xia@@ ol@@ ong , her daughter sent a few &quot; little persu@@ ad@@ ers &quot; from her village at their hes@@ itation .
These little persu@@ ad@@ ers are girls and boys of her village who were recommended to attend the training at the same time , including Z@@ hang Bin@@ bin &apos;s c@@ ous@@ in .
Just after coming to X@@ i@@ am@@ en team , Z@@ hang Bin@@ bin once again took the initiative to return to X@@ i@@ ang &apos;@@ an school because of her family difficulties .
But after the repeated efforts of her enligh@@ tening teacher , Z@@ hang Bin@@ bin returned to X@@ i@@ am@@ en team .
And after she came into the provincial team , Z@@ hang Bin@@ bin returned home because she found it almost hope@@ less to enter the national team after a long time .
This time , not only the co@@ ach Z@@ hang Ya@@ ji@@ e , but also the leaders and co@@ ach of X@@ i@@ am@@ en shooting arch@@ ery sports center and Fu@@ j@@ ian provincial team came to her home . With their efforts , Z@@ hang Bin@@ bin was finally persuaded to return to the provincial team .
Just at yester@@ day &apos;s game , the X@@ i@@ am@@ en gir@@ l achieved several re@@ vers@@ als of the shooting with her insistence .
&quot; Each co@@ ach has his own method to choose the potential player . I decided to take her once I saw her beautiful hands . &quot;
Z@@ hang Don@@ gh@@ ong also rec@@ alled , in the training test , although the results of her daughter were not the best , her rings were very stable , which is also an important reason for Z@@ hang Bin@@ bin to attract co@@ aches .
During the training process of Z@@ hang Bin@@ bin , it was the input of this farm@@ er gir@@ l that im@@ pressed Z@@ hang Ya@@ ji@@ e most .
He rec@@ alled that after Z@@ hang Bin@@ bin came into the X@@ i@@ am@@ en shooting team more than a year later , the team carried out a long shot of gun training , requiring players not to move for half an hour .
Z@@ hang Xia@@ ol@@ ong told reporters that her daughter has always been a quiet and well-@@ beha@@ ved child , with the ho@@ b@@ by of pain@@ ting and producing to@@ ys .
&quot; I used to make clo@@ thes and do some s@@ owing jobs . Bin@@ bin picked up some scra@@ ps to make her own doll@@ s . &quot;
She said , her daughter often se@@ wed hand to@@ ys . P@@ lu@@ s , she is good at pain@@ ting and could make anim@@ ated to@@ ys from the dol@@ l &apos;s fac@@ ial features to clothing .
As an athle@@ te , Z@@ hang Bin@@ bin and her family are separate more than being together . As she can only return home during fes@@ tivi@@ ties , she mainly contacts family members by phone in other time .
According to her parents , no matter meeting in person or talking by phone , Z@@ hang Bin@@ bin seldom talked about her hard work but more about some happy things .
Because they cannot often see their daughter , they put away the pa@@ int@@ ings of her childhood and hon@@ ors of consecutive years .
Z@@ hang Xia@@ ol@@ ong showed the anim@@ ation show of her daughter to the repor@@ ter , &quot; She should keep drawing instead if she did not become sho@@ o@@ ter . &quot;
In the living room on the second floor of Z@@ hang Bin@@ bin , there was a cu@@ p@@ board filled with me@@ d@@ als and cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
Z@@ hang Don@@ gh@@ ong put away the me@@ d@@ als ne@@ at@@ ly and placed all cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates into fil@@ es for storage . &quot; This is honor made by Bin@@ bin after a dozen of years &apos; efforts . We feel quite cher@@ ished . &quot;
Recently , He@@ be@@ i Ci@@ x@@ ia@@ o Fund sent a 16@@ ,000-@@ y@@ uan relief sent to six families who lost their relatives in Xia@@ o@@ zu@@ o , Ta@@ it@@ ou and Gu@@ i@@ qu@@ an Vill@@ age of J@@ inj@@ ing Coun@@ ty .
This is another con@@ dol@@ ence and care activity after the fund association rele@@ ases the call for finding &quot; be@@ rea@@ ved children and l@@ one@@ ly old men cau@@ su@@ ed by the flood disaster in July 19 , 2016 &quot; .
The 7@@ 19 heavy rainfall caused heavy disaster to many cities of He@@ be@@ i Prov@@ ince and resulted in the flood disaster of some regions in He@@ be@@ i province . During the period , some people were dead and missing .
The good man &quot; La@@ o Ti@@ e &quot; sacrific@@ ed his life when he helped the community on dra@@ in@@ age , leaving a 2-@@ year-old k@@ id and a wife with child . The moving story of the good man &quot; La@@ o Ti@@ e &quot; made the entire provincial capital moved .
On August 4 , the working personnel of He@@ be@@ i Prov@@ in@@ cial Ci@@ x@@ ia@@ o Fund and volunte@@ ers of He@@ be@@ i Br@@ and Association came to his home and offered his relatives with 3,@@ 200@@ -@@ y@@ uan love don@@ ation .
When Y@@ e Li , the vice president of He@@ be@@ i Br@@ and Association acknowledged the situation of &quot; La@@ o Ti@@ e &quot; , they immediately decided to carry out &quot; love charity &quot; activities among enterprise members to help &quot; old iron &quot; family to ride out the storm .
He@@ be@@ i Prov@@ in@@ cial Ci@@ x@@ ia@@ o Fund , known as Ci@@ x@@ ia@@ o Fund of the He@@ be@@ i Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er Service Foundation , was initiated by the He@@ be@@ i Br@@ and Pre@@ par@@ atory Committee , and established in August 2015 .
According to a Hong Kong O@@ ri@@ ental D@@ aily report made on August 12 , the current diam@@ ond sales in Main@@ land China were accused of three major problems , including the false marking of diam@@ ond clarity to raise sales price , false diam@@ ond weight and un@@ guaranteed after@@ sales , etc .
An@@ tw@@ er@@ p is one of the world &apos;s largest diam@@ ond trading centers . The diam@@ ond cutting technology of local arti@@ s@@ ans is well-known . All diam@@ on@@ ds on sale have under@@ gone rigorous identification , deeply welcomed by the mainland la@@ dies .
&quot; A small clo@@ th ba@@ g , holding in one &apos;s hand , such ligh@@ t-@@ weighted , is worth of almost one million y@@ uan &quot; , a woman sur@@ named Liu who participated in the purchase of diam@@ on@@ ds told of her experience in An@@ tw@@ er@@ p last June to the mainland media .
She buried the diam@@ ond in her ling@@ er@@ ie and carried it all day along , including when she went to to@@ il@@ et and took b@@ ath .
She said the diam@@ ond she bought in An@@ tw@@ er@@ p was priced about RMB 5@@ 5,000 per gra@@ m and diam@@ ond of the same quality was retail@@ -@@ priced about RMB 11@@ 1,000 in X@@ ia &apos;@@ men .
Recently , she sold the diam@@ ond with 120 % more than the price she bought and earned two hundred thousand y@@ uan .
According to the provisions of the Main@@ land Cu@@ stom@@ s , diam@@ on@@ ds are neither supplies nor nec@@ es@@ si@@ ties during the trip and thus belong to the scope of goods . So such diam@@ ond should be declared at entry and exit . Otherwise , it shall be classified as smugg@@ ling . People may be sent@@ enced to jail .
According to foreign media reports , on the 10@@ th day of the month of the local time , the British Prime Minister &apos;s D@@ ow@@ ning Street announced that British Prime Minister Te@@ resa Me@@ i will go to Switzerland to spend the summer vac@@ ation , but did not dis@@ close the specific place .
According to some media , after the British referendum off Europe , the new British Prime Minister chose to spend her vac@@ ation on the &quot; neutral country &quot; , Swiss on the European continent . This is symbolic .
The British &quot; Gu@@ ar@@ dian &quot; comm@@ ented that the symbolic neutra@@ lity nature of the Swiss played a role in the choice of the British Prime Minister &apos;s first resort .
British &quot; D@@ aily Te@@ le@@ gra@@ ph &quot; comm@@ ented that Te@@ resa Me@@ i chose to take a vac@@ ation in Switzerland . This is the first time that the British Prime Minister chose to go vac@@ ation in Swiss after Margaret Thatcher .
The choice of these two female prime ministers is quite a contrast to the hot place which Blair and Cameron , the two male prime ministers like to go to .
It is reported that the new British Prime Minister Te@@ resa Me@@ i will return to London on August 24 . A series of important work and activities will be waiting for her .
The British parliament will resume on September 5 . The subject matter covers the second Brexit referendum required by the inter@@ net .
On June 23 , the British held a referendum for Brexit , but the British new prime minister did not want to start the article 50 , which is involved with the Lisbon Treaty before the end of the year .
There are 1,@@ 3@@ 25 existing int@@ an@@ gible cultural heritage projects in Hu@@ ang@@ sh@@ an . Its number and quantity ranked first in An@@ hu@@ i province .
As the inherit@@ ance of int@@ an@@ gible cultural heritage projects of An@@ hu@@ i province mainly relies on oral and fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face passage , many int@@ an@@ gible cultural heritage projects are on the verge of failing to be handed down from past generations . So the application of digital technology for conservation is imperative .
According to the work plan of the Stan@@ ding Committee of the Prov@@ in@@ cial People &apos;s Congress this year , the Stan@@ ding Committee plans to listen to the deliber@@ ation of special work report , and carry out the implementation of banking supervision and management law and special inquiry of serving local economic development .
In mid-@@ August , the Stan@@ ding Committee will organize two research groups to conduct research in some cities to prepare for the special inquiry .
Hu@@ a Ji@@ an@@ hu@@ i pointed out that this was the first time that the Stan@@ ding Committee of the Prov@@ in@@ cial People &apos;s Congress list@@ ened to and deliber@@ ated on the special work report of ver@@ tical administration department and carry out special in@@ qui@@ ries . It is the active exploration for enhancing and exploring the supervision work of the Prov@@ in@@ cial People &apos;s Congress .
In the director department of Kash@@ i , Xinjiang , with the order of the director , the armed police in three regions , namely Kash@@ i , H@@ ot@@ an and Ak@@ s@@ u , followed the order quickly , implemented mo@@ tor-@@ driven and left for the exercise combat zone .
China &apos;s M@@ ars program is coming
China M@@ ars exploration mission aims to achieve surrounding , landing and pat@@ rolling at one time , which has never occurred in foreign countries .
China &apos;s M@@ ars exploration launch target is to step around , land and pat@@ ro@@ l at one time . Such task has considerable difficulty .
Because the M@@ ars pro@@ be can encounter a time window in 26 months , experts are closely working on the project plan and try to launch the first M@@ ars pro@@ be in 2020 .
According to X@@ u D@@ az@@ he , although China &apos;s aircraft has entered a deep space , it is still essential to finish the task of M@@ ars exploration . The detec@@ tion of M@@ ars means that China has stepped into the deep space exploration era in a true sense .
&quot; Every two or three years , there is a chance that M@@ ars is closest to Earth . And at this point , it is most energy efficient to launch the vehicle . &quot;
&quot; Taking into account the mass of M@@ ars detec@@ tors , it will be the job of China &apos;s Long March 5 car@@ rier rocket to complete the launch mission . &quot;
China &apos;s M@@ ars exploration mission aims to achieve surrounding , landing and pat@@ rolling at one time , which has never occurred in foreign countries . There was one time of surrounding and landing before in foreign countries , but the landing failed .
M@@ ars exploration involves a lot of technical areas . In particular , although the ro@@ ver is a space detec@@ tor , it has a distinc@@ tive feature compared with the general space detec@@ tor .
In other words , the M@@ ars pro@@ be should be capable of determining the driving route and equipped with the ability to find obstacles .
According to P@@ ang Z@@ hi@@ ha@@ o , a research@@ er of the fifth institu@@ te of China &apos;s A@@ ero@@ space Science and Technology Group , the reason for human being to favor M@@ ars exploration is because M@@ ars detec@@ tion has significant scientific and technical mean@@ ings and it even matters to the future of human beings .
Currently , the M@@ ars has become the planet with the highest degree of human research . The history of human beings to use space detec@@ tors for M@@ ars exploration almost goes across the entire history of human space exploration .
Therefore , the human beings hope that one day on the M@@ ars to establish a base of resid@@ ence , and ultimately to M@@ ars immigration , it turned into a second home of mankind .
A large number of signs also show that the M@@ ars is likely to be the same as the current Earth , only after billions of years of evolution into the atmosphere thin , low temperature , water deple@@ tion and so on .
Therefore , the detec@@ tion or man@@ ned landing on the M@@ ars for research can help propose a pre-@@ ar@@ ran@@ ged planning to prevent the earth from becoming the second M@@ ars which is difficult for human beings to in@@ habit .
As of June 2016 , the world conducted a total of 11@@ 4 lun@@ ar expl@@ or@@ ations , including 43 M@@ ars detec@@ tion missions .
However , ever since the 1990s , a total of 18 human expl@@ or@@ ations have been carried out and only 14 lun@@ ar detec@@ tions have been conducted .
There are currently five M@@ ars or@@ bit@@ ers and two M@@ ars ro@@ vers at work , but only one lun@@ ar or@@ bit@@ er and one lun@@ ar lan@@ der are at work .
World space powers have developed a detec@@ tion plan with the M@@ ars system as target . So we can see the current M@@ ars detec@@ tion is hot@@ ter than that of moon detec@@ tion .
On Nov@@ . 5 , 2013 , India launched the first M@@ ars pro@@ be &quot; M@@ ang@@ ali@@ an &quot; , and has become Asia &apos;s first country for successful detec@@ tion of the M@@ ars .
&quot; M@@ ang@@ ali@@ an &quot; is used to study the surface , the atmosphere and min@@ eral characteristics of the M@@ ars and explore whether there are signs of meth@@ ane and life on the M@@ ars .
The hardest part of the mission is that the pro@@ be just has one chance before entering the Mar@@ tian atmosphere for a@@ ero@@ dynamic shape and par@@ ac@@ hu@@ te deceler@@ ation .
According to Su@@ n Ze@@ zhou , the chief design@@ er of a M@@ ars detec@@ tor of the China A@@ ero@@ space Science and Technology Corporation , the M@@ ars exploration task is confronted with many technical challenges .
The atmo@@ spheric pressure of the M@@ ars is very low , only 1 % of the Earth &apos;s surface atmo@@ spheric pressure , with high uncertainty .
Scientists have not had a thor@@ ough understanding of M@@ ars factors such as its changes and storm characteristics .
A d@@ ust storm similar to the Earth &apos;s d@@ ust is often formed in the M@@ ars in the summer , which will lead to a sharp decline in solar energy . So a &quot; sleep &quot; mode must be designed for the M@@ ars ro@@ ver and let it wait pati@@ ently until the disappearance of d@@ ust storms .
At the same time , the Mar@@ tian atmosphere has a reducing effect on sun@@ light , which poses a problem for the energy supply for M@@ ars detec@@ tion .
This requires that the detec@@ tor &apos;s sun wing area to be larger , and need to constantly adjust , and strive to align with the sun direction .
In addition , since the gravity of the M@@ ars is only 38 % of that of the earth and much higher than that of the Mo@@ on surface , so the pro@@ be requires higher power .
&quot; The core and the most difficult part of the M@@ ars exploration mission are the a@@ ero@@ dynamic shape and par@@ ac@@ hu@@ te deceler@@ ation process after the pro@@ be enters Mar@@ tian atmosphere . There is just one chance to ensure success . &quot;
According to Su@@ n Z@@ e , it must rely on the detec@@ tor to complete the entire process because the distance between the Earth and the M@@ ars is quite large .
Because there is not so much prop@@ ell@@ ant to offset the high speed , the slowdown should rely on the atmosphere of the M@@ ars while landing the M@@ ars . However , it is quite difficult to simul@@ ate the atmosphere of the M@@ ars on earth .
P@@ ang Z@@ hi@@ ha@@ o said , in general , the way to detect the M@@ ars is similar to the way to detect the moon . The entire process is also &quot; surrounding , landing , pat@@ rolling and returning &quot; to achieve the goal of man@@ ned landing on the M@@ ars .
Because the distance between the M@@ ars and the earth is larger than that between the Mo@@ on and Earth , it needs to overcome a series of more complex technical difficulties before the M@@ ars detec@@ tion .
According to Taiwanese media reports , L@@ in Qu@@ an , the head of Taiwan &apos;s Executive Y@@ uan , announced yester@@ day morning , &quot; Il@@ l-@@ gotten Party As@@ sets H@@ and@@ ling Regul@@ ations by political parties and their accompan@@ ying organizations &quot; will take effective since today .
K@@ M@@ T Vice Chairman Z@@ han Q@@ i@@ x@@ ian said , &quot; Ku@@ om@@ int@@ ang , with a hundred years of history , will step down otherwise without social commitment and responsibility . &quot;
L@@ in Qu@@ an stressed that if the political party , accompan@@ ying organization or tru@@ ste@@ es are in violations of the regulations which prohi@@ bit provisions ban , the Commission will investigate and punish &quot; according to the law &quot; .
L@@ in Qu@@ an also announced that Hong Pe@@ ig@@ en , &quot; Deputy Director of the In@@ dependent &quot; , will serve as the vice chairman of the Il@@ l-@@ gotten Party As@@ sets Sett@@ lement Committee .
He said that G@@ u Li@@ x@@ i@@ ong will be the most appropriate candidate for the Il@@ l-@@ gotten Party As@@ sets H@@ and@@ ling Regul@@ ations . The experience of Hong Pe@@ ig@@ en who dealt with the major cases will serve as the foundation for the committee to un@@ cover the related Il@@ l-@@ gotten Party As@@ sets .
Z@@ han Q@@ i@@ x@@ ian said that , as long as there are party assets today , no one will give you social donations . So if the party were all conf@@ is@@ c@@ ated away , then Ku@@ om@@ int@@ ang can just ask for social support and spon@@ sorship , &quot; You will have chance to go when there are no assets . &quot;
Z@@ han Q@@ i@@ x@@ ian also stressed that even if the Il@@ l-@@ gotten Party As@@ sets H@@ and@@ ling Regul@@ ations goes into effect and the Ku@@ om@@ int@@ ang party assets are not fully conf@@ is@@ c@@ ated , the rest will continue to be conf@@ is@@ c@@ ated as promised , the party asset will go n@@ ull and the party will start from sc@@ rat@@ ch .
O@@ rig@@ inal title : Su@@ it launched by &quot; cor@@ rid@@ or doctor &quot; L@@ an Yu@@ ef@@ en@@ g against CC@@ TV host W@@ ang Z@@ hi &apos;@@ an for reputation inf@@ ring@@ ement fails in instance judgment
The legal ev@@ ening news : Because the CC@@ TV host W@@ ang Z@@ hi &apos;@@ an published his remar@@ ks against the &quot; cor@@ rid@@ or doctor &quot; event on micro@@ blog@@ ging , L@@ an Yu@@ ef@@ en@@ g brought W@@ ang Z@@ hi &apos;@@ an and Beijing Mic@@ ro Dream Ch@@ u@@ ang@@ ke Net@@ work Technology C@@ o . , L@@ t@@ d@@ . to the court .
Y@@ est@@ er@@ day after@@ no@@ on , Hai@@ dian court sent@@ enced the case and the verdict said that W@@ ang Z@@ hi &apos;@@ an and Mic@@ ro Dream Comp@@ any did not constitute the inf@@ ring@@ ement and dismissed the L@@ an Yu@@ ef@@ en@@ g for all the claims .
At the beginning of 2014 , CC@@ TV repor@@ ter W@@ ang Z@@ hi &apos;@@ an found after his survey that although L@@ an Yu@@ ef@@ en@@ g was sitting in the cor@@ rid@@ or for more than 600 days and was shaped as the tragic hero suppressed by the media , these reports had a lot of false information .
On March 29 , 2014 , the &quot; cor@@ rid@@ or doctor &quot; program produced by CC@@ TV news survey broad@@ cast@@ ed .
All information about the so-called over-@@ medical treatment reported by L@@ an Yu@@ ef@@ en@@ g to the media do not have any evidence support .
In the micro@@ blog@@ ging with real-@@ name cer@@ tification , W@@ ang Z@@ hi &apos;@@ an also said that the reason for L@@ an Yu@@ ef@@ en@@ g to become this is because of his stub@@ born charac@@ ters and parano@@ id personality &quot; .
L@@ an Yu@@ ef@@ en@@ g claimed that W@@ ang Z@@ hi &apos;@@ an should de@@ le@@ te the micro@@ blog@@ ging and apologi@@ zed to him and made compensation of 100,000 y@@ uan for the mental damage sol@@ ati@@ um .
At the time of the trial , the two sides argued whether W@@ ang Z@@ hi@@ an violated the reputation right of L@@ an Yu@@ ef@@ en@@ g .
High@@ light of the 12@@ th day of the month : at the beginning of T@@ rac@@ k and F@@ ield Ev@@ ents , the Chinese team is quite busy and the women &apos;s football association aims to become the top four of the bic@@ yc@@ le games
The bic@@ yc@@ le game is expected to realize the &quot; zero breakthrough &quot; in the Olympic gold me@@ dal while the Women &apos;s World Cup girls will challenge Germany team , the world champion winner for twice and are expected to become the top four .
W@@ ang Z@@ h@@ en was quite outstanding in the two rac@@ es . He won silver me@@ dal for the athle@@ tics world champ@@ ion@@ ship held in Beijing last year and was upgra@@ ded to the individual project champion in the world champ@@ ion@@ ship this May .
According to foreign media reports , Z@@ hang Hu@@ iz@@ h@@ en , the 2@@ 7-@@ year-old Korean arch@@ ery female player won the gold me@@ dal in the women &apos;s arch@@ ery individual t@@ our@@ nam@@ ent . This is the second scor@@ ing of Olympic gold me@@ dal following the team competition . This made she become a double winner .
Z@@ hang Hu@@ iz@@ h@@ en is considered as a late blo@@ om@@ er . She regre@@ ts about not winning the last session of the London Olympic Games tic@@ kets before , but now she prou@@ dly stands on the top of the Rio Olympic po@@ di@@ um .
Z@@ hang Hu@@ iz@@ h@@ en won the gold me@@ dal in Lis@@ a W@@ eng@@ lu , a total score of 6-@@ 2 in the women &apos;s arch@@ ery fin@@ als at the Sam@@ ba Bou@@ lev@@ ard in Rio de Jan@@ e@@ iro , Brazil .
She did arch@@ ery for the first time in the fourth grade of primary school . She won the first individual t@@ our@@ nam@@ ent gold me@@ dal when she was 27 in 2014 . So she is a late blo@@ om@@ er .
Z@@ hang Hu@@ iz@@ h@@ en rec@@ alled , &quot; My performance before high school was too bad to enable me to participate in the national competition .
Z@@ hang Hu@@ iz@@ h@@ en was ranked the fourth at the London Olympic Games quali@@ fication trials . Unfortunately , she lost the Olympic admission and can just watch her colleague and good friend Q@@ i Pu@@ be@@ i score two gold me@@ d@@ als .
Z@@ hang Hu@@ iz@@ h@@ en talked about his gold winning after the women &apos;s individual a@@ wards ceremon@@ y of arch@@ ery . &quot; I tried to sho@@ ot one by one until the last . Maybe it is because this brings me good results and makes me cont@@ ented . &quot;
The 28@@ -year-old Korean arch@@ ery &quot; No@@ .@@ 1 &quot; , and the London Olympic Games arch@@ ery individual t@@ our@@ nam@@ ent winner Q@@ i Fu@@ be@@ i won the b@@ ron@@ ze me@@ dal .
Q@@ i Fu@@ be@@ i was defeated by Z@@ hang Hu@@ iz@@ h@@ en in the sem@@ i@@ fin@@ als and compe@@ ted for the b@@ ron@@ ze me@@ dal with the Mexican player Alex@@ and@@ ra Val@@ en@@ ci@@ a .
Q@@ i Fu@@ be@@ i shed te@@ ars after she knew she won the bl@@ on@@ de me@@ dal . At this time , we can know her pressure .
Fir@@ stly , the co@@ aching staff accumulated rich experience in his gradual study . S@@ econ@@ dly , it needs scientific training , which should be accumulated over time .
The Ar@@ ch@@ ery team helped the team players focus and remain un@@ biased via military training and going through the cem@@ e@@ tery during night .
Although not yet confirmed , it is said by many sources that Apple &apos;s 2016 autumn conference will be held in September , and iPh@@ one@@ 7 would really be launched into the market .
Although Apple did not respond , there are news release about the function and config@@ uration of the new iPh@@ one . There are even the images of iPh@@ one@@ 7 &quot; real machine model &quot; on the inter@@ net .
The new generation of iPh@@ one is really &quot; e@@ ye@@ -@@ cat@@ ching &quot; , hot and hard-@@ to-@@ get . If you want to buy the genuine product at the first time , you must choose a good channel , for example , Sun@@ ing .
This has exacerbated people &apos;s disappointment of the new iPh@@ one , &quot; It is leng@@ th@@ ened , but cannot be used to cast ho@@ lo@@ graphic images ! This generation of iPh@@ one is so terrible . &quot;
iPh@@ one@@ 7 , just like other iPh@@ ones , brings countless secret before birth .
In addition , there are a number of sources claiming that the new generation of iPh@@ one will have the 3.@@ 5@@ m@@ m head@@ phone j@@ ack cancel@@ led , and adopt Blu@@ e@@ to@@ oth connection and char@@ ging inter@@ face instead , which will provide space for Apple to add a second spe@@ aker .
Another evidence to support this news is that as early as 2014 , Apple will allow head@@ set manufacturers to produce head@@ set products via producing char@@ ging inter@@ face .
Another evidence to confirm this message is that Apple allows the head@@ phone manufactu@@ rer to produce head@@ phone via the connection of charge inter@@ face .
Whether these news are true or false will not be unveiled until the 2016 Apple autumn conference .
But this does not prevent the industry in@@ siders to be optimistic about the prospects of iPh@@ one@@ 7 - many people think that iPh@@ one@@ 7 will be likely to become the last major upgrade of Apple &apos;s iPh@@ one series , although it can be seen from the data released by the market research institution I@@ DC that the market share of iPh@@ one will decline to some degree .
Among them , Goldman Sachs ranked Apple &apos;s stock to be the rating of &quot; buying &quot; while BM@@ O analy@@ st thought that iPh@@ one@@ 7 will obtain a historical high sales achievement .
Meanwhile , Bro@@ ad@@ com CEO H@@ ock T@@ an also said that Apple &apos;s future revenue growth will likely be more than 20 % , which is entirely due to the introduction of iPh@@ one@@ 7 .
7 % of respondents said they have the plan to buy iPh@@ one@@ 7 , while only 4 % people had the plan to buy iPh@@ one@@ 6 .
It is understood that currently 20 % of user groups of iPh@@ one@@ 6 or 6@@ P@@ lu@@ s have such a plan to purchase iPh@@ one@@ 7 . This is a quite high proportion .
S@@ econ@@ dly , according to expert analysis , most of the iPh@@ one fans like to replace their own iPh@@ one mobile phone .
According to statistics , among all iPh@@ one users , about 26 % of users have not changed their phones for 2 years . That is , almost 120 million users of iPh@@ ones have been using the same iPh@@ one for 2 years .
According to media , Taiwan witnessed several earthqu@@ akes during the production period of iPh@@ one@@ 7 . &quot; The destruction of T@@ SM@@ C production facilities is beyond imagination and may impact the initial supply of iPh@@ one@@ 7 . &quot;
Su@@ pp@@ ly and demand contradiction will affect the average user , so it is time to choose a good channel and purchase the genuine iPh@@ one@@ 7 for the first time .
According to informed sources , recently , Sun@@ ing executives and Apple frequently meet , with the purpose to prepare adequate supply .
Oper@@ ators have negotiated with Sun@@ ing . So it is foreseeable that , with the depth of cooperation between the two sides , lower prices and more intim@@ ate services will inevitably bring to users .
&quot; With the lowest price , the consumer may &quot; buy iPh@@ one@@ 7 with just 7 y@@ uan per day &quot; .
A@@ de@@ qu@@ ate supply and a variety of concessions will alleviate the pressure of iPh@@ one@@ 7 buying . Sun@@ ing &apos;s logistics will change such good feeling into more intu@@ itive sense of experience .
Maybe you &apos;@@ ll get a call at mid@@ night . &quot; H@@ ell@@ o , Sun@@ ing T@@ es@@ co , your iPh@@ one@@ 7 is here . &quot;
The organiz@@ ers hope that the local people can understand more about the history of Chinese culture via the cultural re@@ lics exhi@@ bi@@ tion , thereby enhancing the mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples .
As part of the European tour , Bar@@ cel@@ ona &apos;s &quot; M@@ ing D@@ yn@@ asty Her@@ itage Ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion &quot; will continue until early October .
Y@@ est@@ er@@ day , Hu@@ ax@@ ia Bank and Shanghai P@@ ud@@ ong Development Bank issued a semi-@@ annual report of the year 2016 . In the second quarter , China Securities Finance Corporation Lim@@ ited ( CS@@ F@@ C ) will once again buy their shares .
Among them , CS@@ F@@ C will hold an additional 29@@ .@@ 29@@ 31 million shares of Hu@@ ax@@ ia Bank . By the end of June , CS@@ F@@ C will increase its shares of Hu@@ ax@@ ia Bank to 38@@ 7 million shares , raising its shares of Hu@@ ax@@ ia Bank from 3.@@ 35 % to 3.@@ 62 % .

According to foreign media reports , the &quot; green pool &quot; incident of Rio Olympic Games gained much attention because its di@@ ving pool water was changed from blu@@ e to green .
However , on the morning of the 10@@ th day of the month , the water of the match pool ad@@ jac@@ ent to the water pool also turned green .
Australian water pol@@ o con@@ te@@ stant said that his eyes feel ting@@ ling and would like to shed te@@ ars .
Pre@@ viously , Rio officials confirmed the situation of water gre@@ ening , and said the water color is due to the weakening of al@@ k@@ al@@ ine reasons and will not affect the athle@@ te &apos;s health .
However , after Australian players achieved success with the Japanese delegation in the water pol@@ o pool , they said their eyes felt pri@@ c@@ king .
When the water of di@@ ving pool turned green , the hosting party worked over@@ time to deal with the di@@ ving pool problems in the ev@@ ening of the 9@@ th day of the month and found the rapid change of water pol@@ o pool in the morning of the 10@@ th day of the month .
During the competition period of the Australia and Japanese team , the environmental conditions of the water pol@@ o p@@ ond gradually worsened , but the official stressed that they would manage to return the water quality of the two po@@ ols to their original col@@ ors on the 11@@ th day of the month .
Mario An@@ dra@@ da , the spokes@@ man of Rio Olympic Games said , &quot; The al@@ k@@ al@@ in@@ ity of water quality in the di@@ ving pool fir@@ stly turned weak after the yester@@ day after@@ no@@ on &quot; .
&quot; We learned about a series of causes that could cause dis@@ col@@ oration of water and result in the al@@ k@@ al@@ in@@ ity of water quality . &quot;
The water sports center conducted a series of tests on water quality , and hundreds of di@@ vers and sw@@ im@@ mers used the sw@@ im@@ ming pool to determine whether the water quality meets criteria . &quot;
&quot; We have been following the normal procedure these days , but we may have overlooked the impact of more athletes on water quality . &quot;
&quot; But the change in water color certainly has no effect on health , especially for athletes . &quot;
&quot; This independent team confirms our assessment and confirms the measures we have taken to restore the normal color and normal chemical status of the pool . &quot;
&quot; We had hoped that the pool would return to normal color in the morning , but the speed of recovery was affected by the rain . &quot;

On the morning of August 12 , the State Council Information Office held a press conference on the operation of the national economy in July 2016 .
Sh@@ en@@ g Y@@ uny@@ un , spokes@@ man of National Bu@@ reau of St@@ atis@@ tics and head of National Economic St@@ atis@@ tics Di@@ vision said that , in July , the part index number of national economy slowed relatively but still operated in the reasonable range .
According to the data of National Bu@@ reau of St@@ atis@@ tics , the fixed asset investment growth , total imports and other data in July have come down .
Sh@@ en@@ g L@@ ai@@ y@@ un said , as for the national economy in July , I would like to use the words of Premier , &quot; the shape is volatile and the potential is still good &quot; . This is a better way to sum@@ mar@@ ize the characteristics of the economic operation in July .
He explained that &quot; the shape of the fluctuations &quot; ref@@ ers to the fall after rise of some economic indicators growth rate in July .
In July , the domestic and international economy is still in the deep adjustment , the international situation is complex and volatile and the world economic recovery is less than expected , so the export pressure is still relatively heavy .
As for the domestic situation , the whole economy is still in the critical stage of adjustment , adjustment labor pa@@ ins are rele@@ asing and the economy is under great pressure , so some indicators are still fluctu@@ ating .
Sh@@ en@@ g L@@ ai@@ y@@ un pointed out that there was a special case in July , with serious floods , high temperature and hot weather which have brought some impact on production and operation of some areas .
According to the recent report of the Ministry of Civil Affairs , more than 60 million people were affected , with direct economic losses of more than 200 billion y@@ uan .
From the view of industrial , investment and trans@@ port@@ -related indicators , these areas are affected to varying degrees .
The car@@ go tur@@ no@@ ver growth rate in July fell back 3.6 percentage and floods on these areas have a certain impact on traffic .
From these factors , it is quite normal to have some fluctuations in some indicators . And such thing is expected .
He said , &quot; The potential is still good &quot; means that despite the fall@@ back of economic growth , the overall economic performance is stable and steady . And the good momentum has not changed .
In July , CPI rose by 1.8 % , with a mon@@ th-@@ on-@@ month rise of 0.2 % . From January to July , CPI rose by 2.1 % , so the overall price situation is stable .
According to the statistics of hot weather in the districts and coun@@ ties by the port@@ al of the Ch@@ ong@@ q@@ ing Mun@@ ici@@ pal Bu@@ reau of Me@@ te@@ or@@ ology , in addition to You@@ yang , the rest of the city can receive different degrees of high temperature allow@@ ance .
At present , at least 28 provinces in the country have clearly defined the standard of the allow@@ ance , but the standards issued by provinces and munici@@ p@@ alities are not the same , and people in Ch@@ ong@@ q@@ ing receive the allow@@ ance based on the count of high-@@ temperature working days .
In case of temperature between 35 and 37 ℃ , people can receive allow@@ ance of no less than 10 y@@ uan per day . In case of temperature above 37 ℃ , people are released with the allow@@ ance of not less than 15 y@@ uan .
In case of temperature above 40 ℃ , staff working in high temperature can receive up to 20 y@@ uan per day of allow@@ ance ( but for lab@@ ore@@ rs who enjoy the high temperature job allow@@ ance ) .
In accordance with this standard , people in K@@ a@@ iz@@ hou which has the highest number of high temperature can receive 3@@ 30 y@@ uan . And people in Ch@@ eng@@ k@@ ou with the least days of high temperature can receive 80 y@@ uan . And the maximum temperature of You@@ yang did not meet the high temperature standards , so there is no high temperature allow@@ ance .
In the past , many companies adopt cool drin@@ ks as high temperature allow@@ ance . The city safety supervision bu@@ reau deemed that this behavior does not meet the current regulation .
Emp@@ loy@@ er shall not deduc@@ t or reduce the wages of workers in case of termin@@ ating work and reducing working hours in high temperature weather .
The city &apos;s Human Res@@ ources and Social Security Bu@@ reau said that if employees did not receive high temperature allow@@ ance while working under high temperature , they may fight for the legitimate rights and interests via the labor dispute medi@@ ation organization or di@@ al 12@@ 3@@ 33 for compla@@ int .
If the employing unit refuses to pay the high temperature allow@@ ance , the lab@@ ore@@ r may lo@@ dge a compla@@ int with the competent department of human resources social security at the coun@@ ty level or above .
At the same time , because the high temperature allow@@ ance is part of the wage and not welfare , such allow@@ ance shall be included in the total wages , with tax deduc@@ ted .
So the high temperature allow@@ ance is not within the minimum wage , it must be issued in cash and not substitu@@ ted by physical obj@@ ects such as drin@@ ks .
The newly built U@@ rum@@ q@@ i station is located in U@@ rum@@ q@@ i high-speed rail area , with the whole construction area of around 100,000 square meters .
The la@@ yer 1 and 2 are for ent@@ rance , waiting room and office , commercial use while the la@@ yer -@@ 1 is for exit .
At present , U@@ rum@@ q@@ i station is Xinjiang &apos;s largest integrated transport hub , integrated with high-speed rail , rail transportation , public transportation and rental as one . People can achieve a variety of se@@ am@@ less doc@@ kings .
There are a total of 3 tic@@ ket offices on the north and south sides of the platform la@@ yer , equipped with man@@ ual tic@@ ke@@ ting win@@ dow@@ s and 34 automatic tic@@ ket machines .
There are a total of 30 channels on the east and west side of the waiting h@@ all . P@@ ass@@ eng@@ ers can check the tic@@ ket on the tic@@ ket number for quick inspec@@ tion and waiting .
If you need help , you can choose the 41 call butt@@ ons and get timely services .
From July 1 on@@ wards , the old passeng@@ er station , that is , the passeng@@ er train of U@@ rum@@ q@@ i South St@@ ation is shifted to U@@ rum@@ q@@ i station .
In other words , all the C@@ R@@ H trains and the 30 pa@@ irs of other trains depar@@ ting from Xinjiang can be par@@ ked at U@@ rum@@ q@@ i St@@ ation .
Now , passeng@@ ers can buy tic@@ kets at these two stations . The train passing time between these two stations is about 10 minutes . P@@ ass@@ eng@@ ers need to pay attention to the detailed name of the initial and termin@@ al station on the tic@@ ket .
U@@ rum@@ q@@ i new passeng@@ er station , after its official launching into operation , will become an important platform to build the national integrated transport city and promote the construction of &quot; Silk Road Economic Z@@ one &quot; and the new district .
G@@ rac@@ ia is a cu@@ te female tou@@ can , ex@@ u@@ ding the bre@@ ath of tropical rain forest .
In Costa Ric@@ a , one of the Central American countries , T@@ ou@@ can G@@ rac@@ ia and its story have long been known .
At the press conference on August 10 , after post@@ oper@@ ative rehab@@ ili@@ tation , G@@ res@@ ham finally appeared and showed people its brand new 3@@ D printing plastic be@@ ak .
This tou@@ can , which had its be@@ ak broken and was dying just one year and a half ago , finally regain@@ ed its new life .
This day not only announced that it has restored health by 100 % , but also signaled its moving into the luxury avi@@ ary to meet its human friends .
The newcom@@ er Gre@@ ci@@ a was slightly shy initially , but soon became li@@ vely , rolling in the bas@@ in fro@@ li@@ c and eating gra@@ pes with a new be@@ ak .
In order to remind people that it has suffered damage , the technical staff did not give it a new be@@ ak color , but to retain the original white color of the 3@@ D print material .
The be@@ ak is a thin la@@ yer of hor@@ ny she@@ ath , which is hol@@ low inside and only has some of the thin bone to support .
Despite this internal rein@@ for@@ cement , the tou@@ can &apos;s be@@ ak is fragile and may be broken when it is hurt .
An@@ im@@ al rescue center , or@@ ni@@ tho@@ logist and a US 3@@ D printing company worked together to prepare several &quot; test be@@ ak &quot; for G@@ rac@@ ia and finally built a &quot; perfect be@@ ak &quot; for it .
Now G@@ rac@@ ia has been able to use the new be@@ ak to d@@ rink water , eat , and even pec@@ k fine gra@@ ins .
&quot; The design of the finished product costs about two months and it just takes 4-@@ 5 hours to print it . &quot;
&quot; 3@@ D printing is not the future technology but really enters into your life . &quot; Thomas L@@ ange , the chairman of US SG@@ 3@@ D printing company said in an interview with Xin@@ hu@@ a International .
In January 2015 , G@@ rac@@ ia , lying on a farm in the town of A@@ la@@ ju@@ ela in the middle of Costa Ric@@ a , was found with blood covering on its body .
At that time , its be@@ ak was cru@@ el@@ ly broken by a group of young people . It was completely unable to eat and dying .
After the tragedy of the G@@ rac@@ ia was reported by the media , there are a tide of animal anti-@@ abuse call occurring inside and outside Costa Ric@@ a .
People demand to establish more rigorous animal protection law to enhance the punishment against ab@@ users .
People came spon@@ tane@@ ously to try their ut@@ most to help G@@ rac@@ ia restore its life before hur@@ ting .
Even the invent@@ or of the 3@@ D printing technology , Ch@@ uck H@@ ull , is also involved in the design of the G@@ rac@@ ia be@@ ak .
&quot; The situation of G@@ rac@@ ia is very special , and its remaining part of the be@@ ak is less than 1 c@@ enti@@ me@@ ter , so there are many difficulties in inst@@ alling the new be@@ ak . &quot;
&quot; We first s@@ can@@ ned G@@ rac@@ ia and then designed and produced an extended pro@@ s@@ thesis slightly longer than the rest of its be@@ ak and fixed on its be@@ ak with g@@ lu@@ e . &quot;
&quot; This can reduce the risk of further intru@@ sive damage to G@@ rac@@ ia , &quot; L@@ ange told Xin@@ hu@@ a International .
Before inst@@ alling the pro@@ s@@ thesis , the staff cle@@ ared the broken be@@ ak of G@@ rac@@ ia every day to prevent infection .
Th@@ ous@@ ands of miles away , the story of the T@@ ou@@ can G@@ rac@@ ia tou@@ ched the famous docum@@ entary director Paul@@ a El Re@@ i@@ dia and the news channel producer John H@@ off@@ man .
They recorded a little bit of the process of inst@@ alling a new be@@ ak , and recorded a docum@@ entary &quot; The Coun@@ try of T@@ ou@@ can &quot; , which was played this month on the An@@ im@@ al Plan@@ et Ch@@ an@@ nel .
The docum@@ entary &quot; The State of the T@@ ou@@ can &quot; shows people how a small T@@ ou@@ can has changed a country and how people get involved in the fight against torture of animals .
C@@ ore Ti@@ p : Japanese oil companies expressed vigil@@ ance to the rise of Chinese oil companies , especially known as the &quot; te@@ apo@@ t &quot; of China &apos;s small independent refin@@ ery .
August 12 report on Can@@ ka@@ ox@@ ia@@ ox@@ i web@@ site : Japan &apos;s largest oil company J@@ X Energy believes that &quot; China &apos;s export expansion is one of the reasons for the market downturn . &quot;
Japanese oil companies expressed vigil@@ ance to the rise of Chinese oil companies , especially known as the &quot; te@@ apo@@ t &quot; of China &apos;s small independent refin@@ ery .
China &apos;s oil products are gradually close to Japan &apos;s oil products because the Chinese government has strengthened environmental protection regulations .
Before ob@@ taining the import license for crude oil , &quot; te@@ apo@@ t refin@@ ery &quot; generally refin@@ es oil from the heavy oil , which has high sul@@ fur content and is imported from Russia .
The petro@@ leum products are poor in quality due to high sul@@ fur content and become one of the causes of environmental pollution .
After ob@@ taining crude oil import license , &quot; te@@ apo@@ t refin@@ ery &quot; can import O@@ man crude oil and Russian crude oil , which have low sul@@ fur content and improved petro@@ leum products .
East Fu@@ el General Oil Comp@@ any said , &quot; With China &apos;s domestic oil product quality standards continuing to improve , the refin@@ ing capacity of the equipment also increased .
As a result , the quality of oil products exported from China gradually ri@@ v@@ alled that of Japan ( the world &apos;s highest quality ) .
According to J@@ X Energy , &quot; After the end of 2015 , China began to export high-quality light oil to Australia . &quot; Such light oil products are competitive with Japanese products on the Asian market .
Although the &quot; Japanese high quality oil &quot; falls into a crisis , the Japanese oil companies just adopted the strategy of &quot; exporting to profitable areas while being concerned about the market &quot; .
As China &apos;s exports of petro@@ leum products have a huge impact on the Asian market , te@@ apo@@ t refin@@ ery got more atten@@ tions .

U@@ V not only t@@ ans your skin but also sun@@ bur@@ ns it , so how to make the skin go through the military training , without sun@@ burn ?
Sun@@ block is generally marked with SP@@ F and PA on the package . SP@@ F ref@@ ers to Su@@ n Protection Fun@@ c@@ tion and is targeted at U@@ V@@ B . The common SP@@ F index includes 15 , 30 , 50 , etc .
The product marked with PA is for U@@ VA , so that su@@ nb@@ lock will play a more effective role . U@@ su@@ ally , the intensity of PA is represented with + . An extra + indicates extension of effective protection time .
W@@ ater@@ -based su@@ nb@@ lock with a strong penetr@@ ation is often applied to o@@ ily skin . Sun@@ scre@@ en sp@@ ray is also a good choice .
Cre@@ am@@ y sun@@ scre@@ en is often applied to dry skin . The classi@@ fication of neutral skin generally has no strict rules . Any kind of skin care products are burden to the sensitive skin . So it is recommended to choose pure physical sun@@ scre@@ en products .
Rem@@ ember to apply su@@ nb@@ lock half an hour in advance , because sun@@ scre@@ en products take time to completely penetr@@ ate into the skin .
Because you are exposed to sun longer during the military training , you have to apply the sun@@ scre@@ en products once every two hours to leng@@ then the effect . So keep doing it .
As the skin has just been stimul@@ ated by the sun &apos;s sake , do not immediately use wh@@ it@@ ening products after returning from military training .
After exposure under the b@@ la@@ zing sun for quite a long time , ple@@ ase w@@ ra@@ p the ice with to@@ we@@ l to ease the sun@@ burned skin and alleviate the local heat if condition allowed .

During some n@@ ights , the ion@@ ized la@@ yer is full of free electr@@ ons , which means that the radio signal can go further .
According to the report of Pop@@ ular Science , an American monthly web@@ site , on August 11 , the US Air Force was interested in cop@@ ying this effect .
Although the stable ion@@ izing la@@ yer with a large number of free electr@@ ons may help people listen to the radio at the edge of a university radio station , but this may not be the interest of the US Air Force .
I@@ on@@ ization la@@ yer full of electr@@ ons indicated the radio used by the military has a larger range of broad@@ ca@@ sts . In addition , it may prevent the global posi@@ tioning system ( G@@ P@@ S ) signal from the solar storm .
The final goal may be to build a series of cu@@ be satellite according to the requirement . They may enhance ion@@ ization la@@ yer when necessary .
But fir@@ stly , the team that signed contract with the air force must prove that the scientific principles will work .
Indu@@ stry data showed that the total size of coal production in 2015 was close to 6 billion tons and the national coal production overcapacity reached 1.8 billion tons .
Over the past decade , the State Council has issued a total of five notic@@ es for the elimination of excessive and backward production capacity .
Although the first four notic@@ es are not directly involved with coal industry , the target industry is directly related with coal industry .
From last November to this January , the price of Q@@ in@@ hu@@ ang@@ da@@ o 5@@ 500 k@@ cal steam coal ling@@ ers at 3@@ 70 y@@ uan / ton and 90 % of the coal enterprises fell into a loss .
And since February , coal prices gradually picked up , Q@@ in@@ hu@@ ang@@ da@@ o steam coal prices rose continu@@ ously for four weeks , rose to 16 months high , once clim@@ bed to 4@@ 36 y@@ uan per ton , up nearly 70 y@@ uan per ton over the beginning .
With the price rising , come along the concerns of various industries : will a number of small coal mines resume production ?
In this regard , Ku@@ ang X@@ i@@ an@@ ming , head of the Economic Research Institute of the China ( H@@ ain@@ an ) Reform and Development Institute , conducted an analysis and interpretation .
Ku@@ ang X@@ i@@ an@@ ming : overcapacity cut rou@@ sed the high concerns to various industries . The report card of the overcapacity cut of the coal industry announced today make everyone feel worried indeed .
These three superfic@@ ial factors reflect the reason behind the relative lagging behind of our growth pattern change . That is , the government-@@ led growth has not yet been fundamentally changed .
Second , it is also directly related with the force of local government . During the overcapacity cut process , the funds and the corresponding supporting measures should be in place . From this point of view , the differences are indeed relatively large among different regions .
Thir@@ dly , some of the provinces that are relatively slow in progress may face greater risks if they seek acceleration in progress in the second half of the year .
In this case , relying on the central allow@@ ance to raise funds to promote the process of production capacity may have a negative impact .
First , the overcapacity cut is not a simple cap control .
Our goal is to eliminate the backward production capacity , promote the optim@@ ization of the structure and restructure the new form@@ at of the entire coal industry .
During the process of overcapacity cut deploying , the local government must combine the production capacity and the transformation and upgrading of the coal industry to develop the relevant service industry .
Second , in order to complete this year &apos;s overcapacity cut task within this year , we must give full play to the power of administrative supervision .
Finally , we should strengthen the role of social security .
Because the market is directly related to the employment problem , we have to strengthen the employment skills training of employees .
&quot; The reason for the ranking decline is that Brazilian GDP growth is expected to worsen in the medium term . &quot;
In 2015 , Brazil &apos;s participation in global direct investment was 3.@@ 7 % , down from 5.@@ 7 % in 2014 .
The International Investment At@@ trac@@ tiveness Index of Credit Su@@ is@@ se Bank includes four sub-@@ indices : infrastructure , economic outlook , business environment and direct investment .
In 2015 , Brazil &apos;s international direct investment was $ 6@@ 4.@@ 6 billion , down from $ 7@@ 3.@@ 1 billion in 2014 .
Last year , Brazil &apos;s &quot; green investment &quot; ( in the investment model of building factories abroad ) was $ 17@@ .@@ 9 billion , a year-@@ on-@@ year fall of 2.1 % .
&quot; There are 28@@ 8 &apos; green land investment &apos; projects in Brazil , with an average annual rise of 3@@ 14 from 2003 to 2014 &quot; .
However , in the first half of 2016 , the international direct investment in Brazil had reached $ 3@@ 3.@@ 8 billion , an increase of almost 10 per cent compared to the same period last year .
T@@ it@@ le : Canadian police killed IS supporters : hom@@ em@@ ade bomb attacks down@@ town prepar@@ ations near the end
The tax@@ i company said the tax@@ i was disp@@ at@@ ched to the Dre@@ y@@ fu@@ s before the police arrived .
Canadian police said at a news conference on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day that the information received by the police included the &quot; mar@@ ty@@ r@@ dom video &quot; sent by the young man to the US Federal Bu@@ reau of In@@ v@@ estig@@ ation . According to the video , the young man will launch strike .
According to the German voice , in the video , a man wearing a black Bar@@ ak@@ ell@@ a hat is reading the &quot; K@@ oran &quot; , referred to the crime against Muslims , and vowed to attack a Canadian city sooner .
He said in the video , the attack will occur within 72 hours , and in the rush hour .
The incident is the first time for the police to kill terror suspects before the incident after Canadian Prime Minister J@@ us@@ tin Tru@@ de@@ au came to power last year .
Beij@@ ing-@@ H@@ ang@@ zhou Grand Can@@ al branch channels Old W@@ an@@ f@@ u River and Be@@ id@@ ali@@ u will charge t@@ oll@@ s since September 1 .
The two tribu@@ tar@@ ies will conduct construction via social financing . The charges have been approved by the relevant provincial government departments .
The old W@@ an@@ f@@ u River channel flows through Jin@@ x@@ i@@ ang , Y@@ u T@@ ai and then through the N@@ an@@ yang L@@ ake into the Beij@@ ing-@@ H@@ ang@@ zhou Grand Can@@ al main channel , with a total length of 3@@ 2.5 k@@ m .
According to the navig@@ ation needs , the old W@@ an@@ f@@ u River channel takes the mode of conservation and transformation . D@@ red@@ ging was conducted on the local depth and curve cu@@ t-@@ off on the local sharp b@@ end . Then the navig@@ ation conditions can be improved .
The channel flows through Jin@@ x@@ i@@ ang Coun@@ ty , Ren@@ ch@@ en@@ g area and then through the N@@ an@@ yang L@@ ake into the Beij@@ ing-@@ H@@ ang@@ zhou Grand Can@@ al main channel , with a total length of 19 k@@ m .
The re@@ no@@ vation project of the two water@@ way started construction in February 2011 . The delivery inspec@@ tion was conducted in January 2015 . The investment construction and operation main body is J@@ ining City An@@ ping Can@@ al Lo@@ g@@ istics Service Center .
In accordance with the &quot; loan construction and char@@ ging for re@@ paying loan &quot; principle , J@@ ining City An@@ ping Can@@ al Lo@@ g@@ istics Service Center will collect channel t@@ oll@@ s according to the charge standard approved by Sh@@ and@@ ong Prov@@ in@@ cial Price Bu@@ reau .
Among them , the basic toll is 1.@@ 75 y@@ uan / d@@ w@@ t and mil@@ e@@ age toll is 0.0@@ 5 y@@ uan / k@@ m d@@ w@@ t .
The toll collection date is from June 15 , 2016 to June 14 , 201@@ 9 .
Re@@ porters learned from J@@ ining Por@@ t and W@@ ater@@ way Bu@@ reau that there are a total of 4 toll channels within J@@ ining territory , including Z@@ hu@@ shu@@ i@@ he Ch@@ an@@ nel , B@@ aim@@ a River Ch@@ an@@ nel , Be@@ id@@ ah@@ ang Ch@@ an@@ nel and La@@ ow@@ an@@ f@@ u Ch@@ an@@ nel .
These four channels are Beij@@ ing-@@ H@@ ang@@ zhou Grand Can@@ al tribu@@ tary channels , which are upgra@@ ded and re@@ no@@ v@@ ated in the way of social financing .
Z@@ hu@@ shu@@ i@@ he Ch@@ an@@ nel Up@@ grade Ren@@ o@@ vation Project is the first project adopting the mode of &quot; government + market &quot; for the infrastructure construction of river and ports within Sh@@ and@@ ong province . The government accounts for the major part of investment while social fund supp@@ lements the funding gap .
B@@ aim@@ a River , the la@@ ow@@ an@@ f@@ u River and Be@@ id@@ ali@@ u River and other fe@@ e@@ der routes adopt pure market operation .
The funds allocated by the state finance cannot meet the needs of the project construction and restrict the progress of the channel upgrade .
Social funds for the construction of public infrastructure are in line with national policy requirements and have become a way to break the bott@@ len@@ ec@@ k of funding .
N@@ ing Ze@@ ta@@ o &apos;s performance in the 100 meters fre@@ est@@ y@@ le semi-@@ final has made a lot of Chinese audience speech@@ less .
Ac@@ tually , this 50-@@ me@@ ter fre@@ est@@ y@@ le is not the subject of N@@ ing Ze@@ ta@@ o . His performance and best achievement in Kaz@@ an World Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships also indicate it is not possible for him to make breakthrough in this project .
S@@ ure enough , T@@ a K@@ ung P@@ ao , an author@@ it@@ ative media in Hong Kong , revealed that the biggest reason for N@@ ing Ze@@ ta@@ o to lose is that he has lost interest in sw@@ im@@ ming .
Many factors may have a great impact on his future ideas . He is now more interested in entering the entertainment circle .
After Kaz@@ an World Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships , N@@ ing Ze@@ ta@@ o in@@ stantly become celebr@@ ity with his good look and excellent performance .
As a result , &quot; national husband ( a good match ) &quot; , &quot; fresh little meat &quot; , &quot; gor@@ ge@@ ous &quot; , et@@ c@@ . have become his label .
A variety of business activities came to him . He really have a golden fl@@ ashing prospect .
In this case , that N@@ ing Ze@@ ta@@ o chooses to withdraw and jo@@ ins the entertainment circle , is not only his freedom , but also a seemingly viable way .
After all , he is only 23 years old . After a certain degree of study , he can perform some TV series with his popularity .
But N@@ ing Ze@@ ta@@ o needs to see whether he is qualified enough compared with his predecessors .
At the 2000 Sy@@ d@@ ney Olympic Games , the already 21@@ -year-old Liu X@@ uan came to the end of athle@@ te career .
The beautiful appearance of Liu X@@ uan makes her quickly remembered and also lays a foundation for her to join the entertainment circle .
After retirement , Liu X@@ uan star@@ red in a number of TV series , and in 2013 she set up her own stu@@ di@@ o .
T@@ ian Li@@ ang participated in the single and double ten-@@ me@@ ter match of two Olympic Games , and won 2 gold and 2 silver .
But when he was defeated by his counterpart Hu J@@ ia at the single 10-@@ me@@ ter match in the 2004 Olympic Games , T@@ ian Li@@ ang &apos;s competitive state sli@@ pped and it was said he was dismissed by the di@@ ving team .
But when he took along his daughter to participate in the variety show &quot; D@@ ad , Where Are We Go@@ ing ? &quot; , he became a focus .
The once gold generation Y@@ ang We@@ i , Li Xia@@ open@@ g and Chen Y@@ i@@ bing all participated in a variety of variety show .
It is worth m@@ enti@@ oning that , Y@@ ang We@@ i and Li Xia@@ open@@ g led the Chinese team and won champion in the 2008 Olympic Games men &apos;s team . Y@@ ang We@@ i even got his individual all-@@ around gold me@@ dal twice and was called as the Al@@ migh@@ ty King .
And Chen Y@@ i@@ bing has become a ring king while leading his team to win the champion in the 2012 Olympic Games men &apos;s team .
But after he was mis@@ judged and lost the gold in the London Olympic Games , his magn@@ anim@@ ous act won him so many fun@@ s .
However , these game players mainly focus on the ven@@ ue , they just touch and then go at the variety show .
However , no matter whether they are retired or active athletes , they need to provide outstanding performance to win in the entertainment circle .
After all , athletes have just stepped into a new area , so it is just a space state for them in case of capabilities and connection .
Even for T@@ ian Li@@ ang and Liu X@@ uan , who are not new in the entertainment circle , common people always think of their performance at the Olympic Games when m@@ enti@@ oning them .
And the introduction of Y@@ ang We@@ i and Li Xia@@ open@@ g at the variety show is always Olympic Games Cha@@ mp@@ ion .
Compared with these people , N@@ ing Ze@@ ta@@ o is slightly weaker for the title of Sw@@ im@@ ming World Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships .
Compared with these people , the title of N@@ ing Ze@@ ta@@ o , a sw@@ im@@ ming world champ@@ ion@@ ship , is not so great .
Moreover , compared with the withdrawal of T@@ ian Li@@ ang , Liu X@@ uan and Y@@ ang We@@ i , et@@ c@@ . at their pe@@ aks , the withdrawal of N@@ ing Ze@@ ta@@ o at 23 after some set@@ back would cause im@@ measurable effects to the negative influence of his image .
After all , at the mention of athletes , people &apos;s requirements on athletes are &quot; not seeking victory but for no fear of danger &quot; . N@@ ing Ze@@ ta@@ o lags far behind from this point .
At the very least , N@@ ing Ze@@ ta@@ o can totally rely on his great looks to win the support of thousands of huge fans .
It is a lot more difficult to be famous in the entertainment circle by just relying on good appearance than training .
You have to listen to your inner voice on your life path . But as for how to choose , N@@ ing Ze@@ ta@@ o should be quite conscious .
On the surface , the online social platform expands our social circle and reduces people &apos;s l@@ on@@ el@@ iness .
The sphere of influence of social net@@ working not only re@@ places the traditional telephone contact , but also gets down to the off@@ line living circle , quietly changing the current social life of the people .
The benefits of online social network are obvious , convenient and quick , so it is particularly vulnerable to the favor of young people .
A survey of college students &apos; social habits shows that 57 % of college students spend more than 5 hours on mobile phone and is almost in@@ separ@@ able to his mobile phone during their daily lives .
&quot; Social network features low cost , fast transmission speed and simultaneous communication among several people . This meets the requirement of modern college students . &quot;
Ex@@ pan@@ ding the inter@@ personal relationship circle , more equal dialogue , avoiding social concerns are major reasons for us to be fas@@ c@@ inated with online ch@@ at .
New com@@ ers in the company love online exchange with colleagues . &quot; We are not familiar with each other when we just come to the company . The likes and comments on social platform makes people much closer to one another . &quot;
People who love to make friends also love online communication . &quot; I lost contact with my friends due to some misunder@@ stand@@ ings . We became familiar again after a few di@@ alo@@ gues on the group ch@@ at@@ ting . &quot;
IT engineer W@@ u Y@@ an is a profound social net@@ working lo@@ vers . His majority social life occurred online and his online contact is several times than that of off@@ line friends .
W@@ u Y@@ an himself admitted that the network is more &quot; in his element &quot; .
&quot; You can respond to your friends when you are willing , because there is a lot of time to think over the words and you can express it more clearly .
&quot; The communication hidden below one &apos;s I@@ D can avoid inter@@ personal clash . This not only has room for maneuver , and even gives each other more time and space to thought and deeds . &quot;
&quot; People of different identities have the same rights and efficiency to speech . V@@ arious social concerns during real life may be eliminated immediately on inter@@ net . &quot;
However , Xia@@ open@@ g , a friend of W@@ u Y@@ an , thought that W@@ u Y@@ an is a &quot; very bor@@ ing o@@ ta@@ k@@ u . &quot;
Xia@@ open@@ g and W@@ u@@ yan meet each other in the group ch@@ at@@ ting . They two get familiar with each other because they are active spe@@ akers .
Xia@@ open@@ g thought that W@@ u@@ yan is quite different from the one on inter@@ net . He is quite bo@@ red and does not take the initiative to express his views . His words are repeated like this , &quot; O@@ h , yes , right &quot; , or &quot; I will check it online &quot; .
L@@ ing@@ shu@@ i police has been involved in the investigation while L@@ ing@@ shu@@ i traffic sector will also intensify efforts to rec@@ tify illegal operation of vehicles .
&quot; The conflict on August 4 has not yet obtained investigation results . Around 0 o &apos;@@ clock on August 11 , the tax@@ i of another two drivers was sm@@ ashed in the resid@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; Now the tri@@ cycle is mostly and il@@ legally operated at night . We hope the competent authorities can also intensify efforts to carry out re@@ no@@ vation . &quot;
Jour@@ n@@ alists from N@@ an@@ hai web@@ site learned from the L@@ ing@@ shu@@ i Li A@@ ut@@ onom@@ ous Coun@@ ty Public Security Bu@@ reau that , the police have now accepted these two cases . The reasons for the two cases , who did it and whether they are related and so on still need further investigation .
W@@ ang W@@ en@@ y@@ i , head of the traffic management station of L@@ ing@@ shu@@ i Trans@@ portation Bu@@ reau said that L@@ ing@@ shu@@ i transport sector began to rec@@ tify the illegal operation of the passeng@@ er tri@@ cycle and ban a total of 6@@ 13 passeng@@ er tri@@ cycles of illegal operation .
The next step is that , the transport sector will apply to the coun@@ ty government and work with several departments to enhance their input on rec@@ ti@@ fying the coun@@ ty &apos;s tri@@ cycles , mo@@ tor@@ cycles , and un@@ licen@@ sed tax@@ i , etc .

After examination , the doctor told the old man that this was not bar@@ bi@@ ers but seas@@ onal ec@@ z@@ em@@ a . And the doctor advised him not to use medic@@ ation arbitrary to avoid treatment delay .
&quot; In this village , we provided medic@@ ation and ul@@ tra@@ s@@ oun@@ d-@@ B service , while in another village , Q@@ i@@ u J@@ ia D@@ ian Z@@ i Vill@@ age of Hu B@@ u T@@ own of W@@ uli@@ an Coun@@ ty , free medical service was provided by the service team . &quot;
This free clin@@ ic is only one part of &apos; healthy Chinese &apos; , in the days to come , other activities will continue to carry out . &quot;

The People &apos;s Bank of China will handle the cancel@@ lation and renewal of the relevant &quot; Pay@@ ment Business L@@ ic@@ ense &quot; after the business undertaking work is completed .
Because there are serious business ir@@ regul@@ arities , business stagnation or the application for the termin@@ ation of business types of some payment agencies , etc . , this renewal will reduce its business scope .
The relevant agencies shall , within 6 months from the date of the announcement , stop the relevant payment business in an orderly manner .
The People &apos;s Bank of China will continue to carry out the renewal of &quot; Pay@@ ment Business L@@ ic@@ ense &quot; in accordance with the law .

The atten@@ ding leaders awarded together for the second bat@@ ch of &quot; Lo@@ ve Yu@@ an@@ sh@@ an &quot; L@@ ei@@ f@@ en@@ g private fle@@ et .

On August 11 , when the repor@@ ter called Hu@@ ang Y@@ ili@@ n , who was in his Mi@@ an@@ yang home , she said , &quot; At that time , it was too urgent . And there was just one idea , which is to rescue people ! &quot;
Hu@@ ang Y@@ ili@@ n was a student of grade 2015 in the L@@ and@@ scape Ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ecture College of Central South University of Fore@@ stry and Technology .
Ma@@ jo@@ red in urban and rural planning , Hu@@ ang Y@@ ili@@ n wanted to visit S@@ ic@@ hu@@ an L@@ ang@@ zh@@ ong and learn the local archit@@ ec@@ tural design , so the family were bound for there .
At around 10 a@@ .@@ m@@ . on August 8@@ th , Hu@@ ang Y@@ ili@@ n &apos;s father was having a rest in the hotel , while Hu@@ ang Y@@ ili@@ n and his mother went to st@@ roll the L@@ ang@@ zh@@ ong ancient city .
Not walking too far , they saw a group of people shou@@ ting , so they approach@@ ed for curi@@ osity .
Se@@ eing the &quot; little boy has just disappeared and the little gir@@ l desperately flu@@ t@@ tered in the water , just with her little brain left above the water and keeping sinking &quot; , Hu@@ ang Y@@ ili@@ n , who learned how to swi@@ m hur@@ ri@@ ed@@ ly jumped to rescue people .
After jum@@ ping into the water , the 16@@ 5@@ c@@ m-@@ t@@ all Hu@@ ang Y@@ ili@@ n found that she cannot touch the bottom !
The cal@@ m-@@ looking river had rap@@ ids in the bottom .
But she still desperately sw@@ am to the little gir@@ l .
Hu@@ ang Y@@ ili@@ n said the river was mud@@ dy and run fast . The only 5-@@ me@@ ter distance almost wor@@ e her out .
She tried her best to push the little gir@@ l to the em@@ bank@@ ment . &quot; The slo@@ pe is particularly sli@@ p@@ per@@ y , and I am afraid that I have no strength but to sink . &quot;
So Hu@@ ang Y@@ ili@@ n called to her mother for help . H@@ ear@@ ing her daughter &apos;s call , M@@ s@@ .@@ Y@@ in tried to rescue and was held up by other people .
On August 10 , after the spread of the event of Hu@@ ang Y@@ ili@@ n &apos;s jum@@ ping into the river for rescue . M@@ s. Y@@ in received the con@@ dol@@ ences and compli@@ ments of a lot of friends and relatives as well as the &quot; concerns &quot; of many relatives and friends .
&quot; Now , in retro@@ sp@@ ect , it &apos;s really sc@@ ared ! To be honest , when my child does not hold on to the ri@@ ver@@ bank , my heart is broken soon . &quot;
M@@ s. Y@@ in said with a lingering fear that , despite the danger , she will still support her daughter &apos;s choice and she is proud of her daughter even if she was placed in that scene again !
Because she was forced to learn sw@@ im@@ ming , she seldom went to swi@@ m after ma@@ stering the skill . &quot; I did not expect this skill really to come in hand@@ y . &quot;
According to Chen Y@@ i@@ yang , her supervis@@ or , Hu@@ ang Y@@ ili@@ n is the &quot; The Stra@@ ight A Stu@@ dent &quot; well-known in her class and ready to help .

&quot; To save time for the elderly , the system is upgra@@ ded . The elderly free card is reduced from au@@ dit@@ ing twice per year to once per year . El@@ derly people with card do not need to comm@@ ute twice . &quot;
According to the official micro@@ blog@@ ging news of the China Securities Regul@@ atory Commission ( CS@@ RC ) , the securities market supervision department is co@@ operating closely with the Sh@@ en@@ zh@@ en Sto@@ ck Exchange and the Hong Kong Sto@@ ck Exchange .
At the same time , the Commission set up a &quot; Sh@@ en@@ zh@@ en-@@ Hong Kong stock market transactions inter@@ connection mechanism &quot; special working group , and actively promote the prepar@@ atory work . The work will be open this year after the full preparation of the related regulatory rules and technical equipment .
People who sent a certain amount of mass fraud messages may be punished for crime of sw@@ ind@@ ling even if they did not succeed in fraud .
The court trial of N@@ an@@ yang Wol@@ ong Dist@@ ric@@ t People &apos;s Court of Hen@@ an province found that the def@@ end@@ ant Li Hu@@ i@@ w@@ ang sent fraud information through the p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ base station equipment in T@@ ong@@ bai coun@@ ty and N@@ an@@ yang district between September 30 , 2009 and October 4 , 2009 .
In the same year , at 10 a@@ .@@ m@@ . on October 5 , 2009 , the def@@ end@@ ant once again came to a hotel room of N@@ an@@ yang City Wol@@ ong Dist@@ ric@@ t , where they sent fraud messages via a fake base station . He was arrested by the police .
After the assessment , the p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ base station equipment sent 6@@ 2,@@ 2@@ 28 text messages on October 4 , 2015 . This resulted in 8 secon@@ ds to 10 minutes of interrup@@ tion of 6@@ 2,@@ 2@@ 28 mobile phone users .
After legal proceedings , the court held that the def@@ end@@ ant Li Hu@@ i@@ w@@ ang used p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ base station to send a total of 6@@ 2,@@ 2@@ 28 fraud messages to a specific number of people . His behavior already constituted a crime of fraud .
As the def@@ end@@ ant was attempted criminal , not resulting in terrible consequences and having good attitude toward admission of guilt while being caught , it is advis@@ able to take the opinion of giving a lesser punishment .
Consider the comprehensive crime nature and the attitude toward admission of guilt of the def@@ end@@ ant , he was sent@@ enced to 4 years and 6 months of imprisonment , and fin@@ ed 10,000 y@@ uan .
Si@@ ber@@ ian tig@@ ers are currently classified as endangered ( E@@ N ) by the World Conserv@@ ation Union ( I@@ U@@ CN ) Red Li@@ st of En@@ dan@@ ge@@ red Sp@@ ec@@ ies .
According to the J@@ ili@@ n Prov@@ in@@ cial Fore@@ stry Department , the data jointly monitored by the United States and Russia and other countries in 1998 showed that J@@ ili@@ n Prov@@ ince only had 4 to 6 man@@ ch@@ uri@@ an tig@@ ers and 3 to 5 Northeast le@@ op@@ ards .
According to Y@@ u Chang@@ ch@@ un , the Director of J@@ ili@@ n Prov@@ in@@ cial Department of Fore@@ stry Protection , J@@ ili@@ n province has gradually enhanced its conservation on wild animals in recent years . The number of populations of man@@ ch@@ uri@@ an tig@@ ers and Nor@@ the@@ astern le@@ op@@ ards is growing significantly
The latest monitoring data in 2015 showed that 27 wild man@@ ch@@ uri@@ an tig@@ ers and 42 Nor@@ the@@ astern le@@ op@@ ards were monitored within J@@ ili@@ n province territory .
The cooperation between China and Russia is significant for the population restoration and re@@ production of man@@ ch@@ uri@@ an tig@@ ers and Nor@@ the@@ astern le@@ op@@ ards , which are flag@@ ship species for the wild animal protection in the Sino-@@ Russia boun@@ dary area , .
According to J@@ ili@@ n Prov@@ in@@ cial Fore@@ stry Department , J@@ ili@@ n Prov@@ in@@ cial government has established long-term stable cooperation and exchange mechanism with Russian government .
At the 2016 China Hun@@ ch@@ un Tig@@ er and Le@@ op@@ ard Protection International Forum which was termin@@ ated on September 11@@ th , the fore@@ stry department and animal protection organization of China and Russia reached several consen@@ su@@ ses for the second time .
According to the J@@ ili@@ n Prov@@ in@@ cial Fore@@ stry Department , the cooperation on enhancing the protection of tig@@ ers and le@@ op@@ ards of China and Russia is not only quite pressing task for the protection of man@@ ch@@ uri@@ an tig@@ ers and Nor@@ the@@ astern le@@ op@@ ards , but also a priority to maintain the population health of tig@@ ers and le@@ op@@ ards of Russia .
Su@@ n Fu@@ j@@ ian is a Party cad@@ re , but he lost his ideal and belief by viol@@ ently breaking the discipline of the Party after the 18@@ th National Congress of the Communist Party of China . In addition , he is not astr@@ ingent and breaks the rules . Such deed is v@@ ile and grave indeed .
After the oc@@ curren@@ ce of this case and a number of media reports , this has become the focus of the case , with extremely bad social impact .
After the case , Hai@@ k@@ ou City Public Security Bu@@ reau of Inter@@ po@@ l de@@ t@@ achment leaders att@@ ach great importance and immediately organize a de@@ t@@ achment of elite troops to take the initiative to investigate .
The police immediately pursued and attacked the suspect on the inter@@ net and took a variety of measures to control . In addition , the police cont@@ acted their colleagues of other cities to investigate the where@@ ab@@ outs of W@@ ang .
As the suspect is a ste@@ aling reci@@ divi@@ sm and repeatedly dealt with by the public security organs , he has strong anti-@@ re@@ conn@@ aissance capabilities . In addition , due to his long-term drug abuse , the often drug addiction makes trial work quite difficult .
Green@@ land shar@@ ks are also known as small head sle@@ eping shar@@ ks , widely distributed in Green@@ land and the North Atlantic waters around Iceland . It has the length of 4 to 5 meters in their adult age .
But their growth rate is extremely slow , sometimes only about 1 c@@ m a year , suggesting that Green@@ land shar@@ k may have an extra@@ -@@ long life .
Tra@@ ditional dating methods usually use cal@@ ci@@ fied tissue of animals . Some fin@@ s can use fin@@ s , but this cal@@ ci@@ fied tissue is very scarce in Green@@ land shar@@ ks .
A new study led by Ju@@ li@@ us N@@ elson of the University of Copenhagen , Denmark , turned to the use of Green@@ land shar@@ k &apos;s oc@@ ular l@@ ens for radio@@ active carbon dating .
This method had previously been used to determine the age of wh@@ ales , but it is the first time to be used to determine the age of shar@@ ks and other fish .
Their analysis showed that the life span of the largest shar@@ k is estimated at 39@@ 2 years old , with the error of 120 years old .
That is to say , this shar@@ k is aged at least 27@@ 2 years old . The maximum age may be 5@@ 12 years old .
In addition , the female Green@@ land shar@@ k is alleged to be sex@@ ually mat@@ ured at about 4 meters in length . That is , it can only reach adul@@ tho@@ od at least until the age of 15@@ 6 .
The researchers thus wrote in the paper that the Green@@ land shar@@ k was known as the ver@@ te@@ brate with the longest life span on the Earth , sur@@ passing the age of the previous long@@ ev@@ ity champion black right wh@@ ale ( 2@@ 11 years ) .
Over the past year , the exchange reform results are significant , with RMB exchange rate remaining basically stable , but also laying foundation for promoting the internationalization of the RMB .
From the point of market performance , over the past year , the two-@@ way floating characteristics of RMB exchange rate is outstanding . The el@@ as@@ tic@@ ity of exchange is expected to be strengthened and the exchange rate is expected to be generally stable .
Ever since the exchange reform , the fluctu@@ ation of RMB against the US dollar often appears , with ups and downs during the process .
Last year , the last remit@@ tance measure before &quot; 8.@@ 11 &quot; exchange reform was carried out in 2005 . The appreciation of y@@ uan against dollar was significant during the last 10 years .
Since the implementation of the new exchange reform , the previous appreciation state of RMB was changed . The central parity rate of RMB exchange rate in one year was about 8 % .
This October 1 , the International Monetary Fund will officially accept the y@@ uan , which will become SDR weight currency .
This week , China &apos;s General Administration of Cu@@ stom@@ s released statistics show that the first 7 months of this year , China &apos;s import and export value of 13@@ .@@ 21 trillion y@@ uan , down 3 % over the same period last year .
In July , China &apos;s total import and export value fell by only 0.@@ 9 % year on year . In particular , China &apos;s export value had a year-@@ on-@@ year rise of 2.@@ 9 % .
Re@@ lev@@ ant experts believed that despite the signs of stabilization in July , we should not have high expectations .
In July , China &apos;s total import and export valued 2.@@ 0@@ 9 trillion y@@ uan , a year-@@ on-@@ year fall of 0.@@ 9 % .
Among them , the export was valued 1.@@ 22 trillion y@@ uan , up 2.@@ 9 % ; the import was valued 8@@ 73 billion y@@ uan , down 5.@@ 7 % ; trade surplus was valued 34@@ 2.8 billion y@@ uan , an increase of 34 % .
Although the total value of imports and exports fell year on year , the export data enjoyed growth . This is the fifth consecutive month for export to achieve growth since March this year .
Shanghai police captured more than 3,@@ 400 th@@ i@@ eves and comb@@ ated 15@@ 7 &quot; ro@@ b@@ ber@@ y fraud &quot; gang@@ s in 4 months
While detec@@ ting the case at the same time , the police also pressed for payments and recovered stolen goods total@@ ing more than 33 million y@@ uan .
According to the the@@ ft gang members , they came to Shanghai in the way of char@@ tering un@@ licen@@ sed tax@@ i . Then they came down the tax@@ i and gathered and took tax@@ i several hours later . Finally , they left Shanghai together .
During the crime off@@ ence period , the criminal suspects swept the floor for the@@ ft from top to below by clim@@ bing the external wall and breaking the window f@@ ence .
Recently , the suspect involved was transferred by X@@ u@@ hu@@ i Public Security Bu@@ reau to X@@ u@@ hu@@ i Dist@@ ric@@ t Pro@@ cur@@ at@@ or@@ ate for prosecution .
Poli@@ ce reminded the general public to lock the doors and win@@ dow@@ s before going out . In addition , citizens are recommended to choose the relatively hard steel material for anti-@@ the@@ ft window .
In late August , Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will go to Kenya to attend the 6@@ th African Development Conference , according to the E@@ ven@@ ing News Pe@@ ak of Vo@@ ice of China .
The African Development Conference was dominated by Japan , and the previous five meetings were held in Tokyo , Japan or Y@@ o@@ ko@@ ha@@ ma , so this meeting will be the first move to Africa .
Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said the meeting held in Africa will help to attract atten@@ tions of African and European countries to Japan .
In line with the trip of Shinzo Abe , according to Ky@@ o@@ do news agency , the Japanese Liberal Democrats will send parliamentary groups to the countries concerned .
Japan &apos;s &quot; application to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council &quot; began in the early 9@@ 0s of the last century while the African@@ -@@ sponsored African Development Conference also began in 1993 . This is not a coincidence .
Africa has 53 seats in the United Nations and is therefore an important tic@@ ket bun@@ ker of the United N@@ ation . How can Japan give up Africa if it wanted to join the United Nations Security Council ?
It will also exchange views with national stakeholders on the extreme organization of &quot; Islamic State &quot; and terrorist activities .
&quot; Western Group &quot; will visit seven countries , including Sierra Leone , Liberia and Guinea Bis@@ sa@@ u .
F@@ um@@ i@@ o Ki@@ sh@@ ida , the current Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan has also recently stated the intentions of the African Development Conference at the UN Security Council .
Abe has announced here that in order to stabilize the stability of sub-Saharan African countries , it will provide 100 billion yen ( about RMB 6.@@ 1 billion ) in five years .
Ob@@ ser@@ vers generally believe that there are two purposes behind Japan &apos;s gener@@ osity toward Africa : first , to increase Japan &apos;s presence in Africa ; second , to win the support of African countries on the application to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council .
&quot; In terms of politics , Africa is relatively lagging behind , but there are many African countries . So Japan has always regarded it as the so-called &apos; big tic@@ ket field , &apos; &quot; said Y@@ ang Bo@@ jiang , an expert for Japanese issues .
Japan will not give up in the future and its work on Africa will not be termin@@ ated but gradually strengthened .
Econom@@ ically , Japan enjoys a strong production capacity , but its domestic market is relatively limited . In particular , the domestic demand is relatively weak in the context of aging population .
However , from Jun@@ ich@@ iro Koizumi , who was Japan &apos;s prime minister 10 years ago , to the present Abe , Japan has repeatedly launched the &quot; sp@@ rint &quot; scheme . However , all schemes were abandoned eventually .
Y@@ ang Bo@@ jiang believed that the inten@@ sion of Japan to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council is be clear at a glance . However , the road is bound to be full of obstacles .
To achieve its own goals , Japan should fir@@ stly do a good job with the surrounding countries . And Japan needs to have a correct attitude no matter in geopolitical competition or in the national dispute or understanding of a historical problem .

Tra@@ ditional customs introduced a new bright spot &quot; 2016 B@@ on Cul@@ ture F@@ es@@ tiv@@ al &quot; -@@ The O@@ pening C@@ e@@ re@@ mon@@ y of Vic@@ t@@ oria Park , Hong Kong
G@@ ong@@ s and dru@@ ms of music , the traditional sn@@ acks , fan@@ cy dec@@ oration and stor@@ my crowd scene .
Organiz@@ ed by the Feder@@ ation of Hong Kong Chi@@ u Ch@@ ow Community Organiz@@ ations , &quot; 2016 B@@ on Cul@@ ture F@@ es@@ tiv@@ al &quot; was held in Vic@@ t@@ oria Park between the 12@@ th day and the 14@@ th day of the month . It &apos;s the largest grand club in Hong Kong .
In addition to the continuation of the existing &quot; C@@ lim@@ bing Com@@ petition &quot; , &quot; parent bas@@ in for the he@@ ap &quot; for the entire family is also added .
B@@ on culture history is introduced in the form of com@@ ic books . In addition , B@@ on theme 3@@ D self-@@ tim@@ er area , traditional sn@@ ack area and traditional craft flow class@@ room are set up at the scene , attracting many friends and overseas travel@@ ers for visit .
A French couple lin@@ ge@@ red at the scene for almost 3 hours and experienced a lot in the min@@ i f@@ lower card flow class@@ room .
&quot; After knowing this special fes@@ tiv@@ al online , I decided to come and I felt quite fresh . &quot;
They said , although there are similar fes@@ tivi@@ ties commemor@@ ating the ance@@ stors , the atmosphere is quite sole@@ m@@ n . But here you can enjoy music , food and also can learn traditional craft .
She said , &quot; It is quite pleasant to see siz@@ able and organized ance@@ st@@ or wor@@ ship ceremon@@ y in such a busy financial metro@@ poli@@ s of Hong Kong &quot; .
&quot; This not only embodies the diversity of Chinese culture , but also allows more people to understand these traditional craft and heritage . &quot;
&quot; We do not want to make the B@@ on Cul@@ ture F@@ es@@ tiv@@ al very horri@@ fying , which may spo@@ ok people , especially the children , &quot; said Hu Y@@ an@@ s@@ ong , the chief responsible person of the event .
&quot; We hope that through the you@@ th@@ ful activities and lay@@ out of the scene , so that young people know that the culture behind the B@@ on F@@ es@@ tiv@@ al is to express the f@@ ili@@ al p@@ ie@@ ty and than@@ k@@ s@@ giving . &quot;
He also said that this time a total of 24 teams participated in &quot; clim@@ bing competition &quot; , which is not only organized by communities , but also in combination with schools and attended by students .
It is understood that the Feder@@ ation of Hong Kong Chi@@ u Ch@@ ow Community Organiz@@ ations is listed as &quot; national int@@ an@@ gible cultural heritage list &quot; in 2011 .
On the ev@@ ening of the 11@@ th day of the month , China National Pe@@ king Oper@@ a The@@ ater took its famous TV play &quot; White S@@ n@@ ake &quot; and traveled thousands of miles to Mexico City . They presented the local people with an auth@@ enti@@ c Pe@@ king Oper@@ a fe@@ ast in the Mexican National Pal@@ ace .
As the key performance project of &quot; Sino-@@ Latin American Cultural Exchange Year &quot; , from August 9 to 23 , China National Pe@@ king Oper@@ a The@@ ater performed seven oper@@ a in the Mexican capital Mexico City and C@@ ó@@ r@@ do@@ ba , Ju@@ are@@ z and other five cities .
The audience sometimes sm@@ iled and sometimes ap@@ plau@@ ded for the changing and conclu@@ ding of the &quot; White S@@ n@@ ake &quot; episode and the actor &apos;s sing@@ ing .
I watched the performance of Mar@@ is@@ sa Jim@@ ene@@ z K@@ achi@@ e accompan@@ ying her daughter in the Pe@@ king oper@@ a performance 15 years ago .
&quot; This is a fant@@ astic performance . Its music , ligh@@ ting and stage perfor@@ man@@ ces are impressive to me ... ... I think it is necessary to let her daughter understand the Chinese culture and Chinese oper@@ a art . &quot;
The enthusiasm of Mexican audience left a deep impression on the young ac@@ t@@ ress of l@@ ady white .
&quot; It never occurred to me that the Mexican audience were so enthusiastic . I had some worries about whether they could understand the story , but it was beyond my expectation to see them catch the story and the lau@@ ghter today .
Q@@ i@@ u Xia@@ o@@ q@@ i , the Chinese ambassador to Mexico , said that the various cultural exchange activities of this year &apos;s &quot; Sino-@@ Latin American Cultural Exchange Year &quot; promoted the two peoples to deepen mutual understanding and enhance their friendship .
Next year is the 45@@ th anniversary for the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Mexico . By then there will be more cultural exchange activities held in China and Mexico .
Liu C@@ ig@@ u@@ i came to S@@ anya for the research of &quot; Dou@@ ble Rest@@ oration and D@@ ual City &quot; and required to enhance the level of urban construction and management
In the morning of 12@@ th day of the month , Liu C@@ ig@@ u@@ i pre@@ sided over a sym@@ posi@@ um , list@@ ened to the report of the progress of the pilot project of &quot; Dou@@ ble Rest@@ oration and D@@ ual City &quot; and the sugg@@ es@@ tions and comments of the relevant departments .
Liu C@@ ig@@ u@@ i provided fully affir@@ mation for the stage results and good experiences and practice .
Liu C@@ ig@@ u@@ i stressed that S@@ anya should firmly grasp the historical development opportunities and take the pilot work of &quot; Dou@@ ble Rest@@ oration and D@@ ual City &quot; as key content to give full play to the leading role of demonstration during the economic and social development in order to firmly grasp historical development opportunities .
We should lead to improve the internationalization of international tourism and enrich international elements and build international b@@ ou@@ ti@@ que from the details .
We should lead in the urban and rural integration and tourism , accelerate the construction of characteristic town and integrate tourism into each project and build each village and town of S@@ anya into tou@@ rist attrac@@ tions .
We should lead in &quot; the 100@@ -@@ day social service investment move &quot; and promote a bat@@ ch of key projects and par@@ k construction to ensure the settlement of high-quality project and implement the various requirements of the big move .
Z@@ hang Q@@ i , the Prov@@ in@@ cial Stan@@ ding Committee and S@@ anya Mun@@ ici@@ pal Party Committee Secretary , W@@ ang L@@ u , vice governor and L@@ u Z@@ hi@@ y@@ uan , secretary general of provincial government participated in the research sem@@ in@@ ars .
In the 14 years of her sports career , Deng Y@@ aping won a total of 18 world champ@@ ion@@ ships , becoming the first Chinese to win four Olympic gold me@@ d@@ als in China &apos;s Olympic history .
She ranked first in the table ten@@ nis for 8 years to maintain the world &apos;s first and is a female athle@@ te to rank as the &quot; the world &apos;s first &quot; for the longest time in the history of table ten@@ nis .
On September 26 , 2010 , she served as Deputy Secretary-General of People &apos;s D@@ aily , general manag@@ er of People &apos;s Se@@ arch Net@@ work C@@ o . , L@@ t@@ d@@ . and the depar@@ t@@ ment-@@ level cad@@ re .
Recently , she will work together with Y@@ u Min@@ h@@ ong to build the first domestic sports industry innovation and entrepreneurship platform .
There was also a team of star co@@ aches in the Chinese sports circle . They were gor@@ ge@@ ous in the era of athletes and won countless gl@@ ory for the country . After retirement , they passed what they learned to the new com@@ ers and cultiv@@ ated a great number of champions .
As the first world champion in Chinese men &apos;s g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics , Hu@@ ang Yu@@ bin chose to pick up the poin@@ ter after retirement .
From the women &apos;s team co@@ ach to the men &apos;s team co@@ ach , to the head co@@ ach , Hu@@ ang Yu@@ bin created an &quot; Olympic gold group &quot; , and led to win 9 gold , 1 silver and 4 copper at the Beijing Olympic Games .
Since then , T@@ ian Li@@ ang has been experiencing advertising endorsement . He has even served as a &quot; Co@@ wh@@ er@@ d &quot; , &quot; Le@@ i F@@ en@@ g &quot; and other important roles in recent years .
Many N@@ BA players have proved their strength . But whenever there is progress , there is decline .
Whether it is because of the increase in age or limited playing time , some players will have reg@@ ressive performance each season .
Of course , some &quot; retreat &quot; may only be data shrink , but the strength of these players may not have been reduced .
Even if W@@ ade is still one of the le@@ ague &apos;s best line@@ back@@ er , his performance in the Bul@@ ls is not so good as that of the He@@ at .
The back@@ court range of he and Lon@@ do is limited . The three-@@ point hit rate of headed star B@@ ut@@ ler is just 3@@ 2.8 % , making their nex@@ t-@@ season off@@ ence quite challenging .
After coming to F@@ en@@ g Chen@@ g , the Red Star will defin@@ itely give the ball right to B@@ ut@@ ler and R@@ on@@ do and he himself choose to play healthy in the regular season .
O@@ ka@@ for &apos;s situation is more embarra@@ ssing . As the first choice of 76 people last season , he had to compete for playing time and ball right with Sim@@ m@@ ons and En@@ by in the new season .
This competition may not come soon . Sim@@ m@@ ons also need to adapt to the N@@ BA st@@ adi@@ um , and En@@ bi must also be fully recovered from the inj@@ ury as soon as possible , but whether O@@ ka@@ for can have a position in the long array of 76 people .
Last season , 32 % of the score of O@@ ka@@ for comes from the low attack . Such rate is higher than C@@ ous@@ ins , W@@ u@@ ch@@ ev@@ ich and Bro@@ ok Lo@@ pe@@ z , while his use rate is also the top 40 in the le@@ ague .
With Sim@@ m@@ ons already showing a good poin@@ t-@@ forward po@@ tention , En@@ bi also has a better stature more suitable for N@@ BA games and O@@ ka@@ for &apos;s position is hard to be so solid .
Over the past two seas@@ ons , Thom@@ p@@ son &apos;s use rate has stabilized in the top 20 of the le@@ ague and this is the best two seas@@ ons for his career .
But the problem is , with the arrival of D@@ ur@@ ant , Thom@@ p@@ son &apos;s appearance ratio will surely decline , which is bound to affect his play .
This effect will not only be the impact of the number of sho@@ ts , Thom@@ p@@ son &apos;s holding attack in the next season will certainly be greatly reduced , which in some ways will reduce the opponent &apos;s defense difficulty .
D@@ ur@@ ant &apos;s arrival will certainly neg@@ atively affect the score of W@@ arri@@ ors players , but the one with the most negative effect is probably that of Thom@@ p@@ son .
But this does not mean that the level of Thom@@ p@@ son steps backward . This is more likely that he made sacrifice for the team as a whole .
Par@@ ker had a better performance than last season . This is not only because his basket efficiency came to the highest level , his chemical reaction with Al@@ dri@@ ch also benefits the S@@ pur@@ s .
D@@ un@@ can retired , G@@ in@@ ob@@ il@@ i announced a second battles for a year and the combination of GDP eventually came to an end . As one of the youn@@ gest among three people , the oil tank of French sports car is not much left .
After getting the third champ@@ ion@@ ship ring , only J@@ ab@@ bar , Jordan and Rus@@ sell won more regular M@@ V@@ P than that of James , while Jordan was the only one who had more F@@ M@@ V@@ P than that of James .
O@@ h , yes , James has just brought the first professional sports champ@@ ion@@ ship tro@@ ph@@ y in C@@ lev@@ eland in the past 52 years .
Coming to the 14@@ th season of his career , James needs to better con@@ serve his strength and get ready for the pla@@ y@@ offs .
Therefore , in the regular season , James &apos;s capability is likely to further decline , he will give more weight to O@@ w@@ en to bear , but he will still easily become the le@@ ague &apos;s top three players .
&quot; I must carry forward what I learned in China to apply to Russia &quot; .
On the 12@@ th day of the month of the local time , Hu@@ ang J@@ ing , chairman of the Moscow Over@@ seas Chinese Association said exc@@ it@@ ed@@ ly while she saw the repor@@ ter of Chin@@ an@@ e@@ w@@ s@@ .@@ com .
Not long ago , she participated in the &quot; overseas Chinese culture community Chinese talent ( cal@@ li@@ graphy , pain@@ ting ) training &quot; hosted by Chinese State Council Over@@ seas Chinese Affairs Office and sponsored by Jin@@ an University .
While participating in the training course just now , she did not know where to start in pain@@ ting and cal@@ li@@ graphy . As a result , after the end of the course , she has been able to draw and write her own works .
After returning back to Moscow , I will use the knowledge and skills learned in China to Russia and make my own contribution for the cultural transmission and promotion of the Chinese culture .
At the same time , N@@ a Y@@ an@@ we@@ i , the Secretary-General of Russian-@@ Chinese Cul@@ ture Pro@@ motion Association who also participated in this training course had the same feeling .
She said that she made great progress with the help of teachers of the training classes and she felt the heavy responsibility of being the &quot; overseas communic@@ ator of Chinese culture &quot;
She said , after she came back to Russia , she would surely carry out the traditional Chinese culture among the Chinese and the Russians who love Chinese culture .
At 19 : 35 today , in one match of the 22@@ n@@ d round of Chinese Foot@@ ball Association Sup@@ er League , Ch@@ ong@@ q@@ ing Li@@ fan Foot@@ ball Club challenged Beijing Gu@@ o@@ an Tal@@ ent Foot@@ ball Club in the visiting field .

One minute later , P@@ u Chen@@ g crossed on the left wing and Y@@ u D@@ abao stra@@ fed the un@@ k@@ ic@@ ke@@ d-@@ out part of the mid-@@ way in the penalty area . Li@@ f@@ ang go@@ al@@ keep@@ er Deng Xia@@ of@@ ang conf@@ is@@ c@@ ated the goal .
Fer@@ nan@@ do fli@@ pped pass the goal in the back@@ -@@ drawing on his right wing . Alan Kar@@ de@@ c was put down by Le@@ i T@@ eng@@ long . The re@@ fe@@ ree sent@@ enced a spot k@@ ick and showed a yel@@ low card to Le@@ i T@@ eng@@ long .
Gu@@ o@@ an changed a person at the 37@@ th minute . Z@@ hang Xia@@ ob@@ in left the playing field and Z@@ hang Ch@@ im@@ ing came on the stage and turned his weapon around to defense .
Alan Kar@@ de@@ c get rid of the ball in front of the penalty area and Fer@@ nan@@ do pushed shot .
This is also the time for Alan Kar@@ de@@ c to score in the initial games of Chinese Foot@@ ball Association Sup@@ er League . Li@@ fan leads in 2 : 0 .

Britain settle for silver in rug@@ by se@@ vens after Fi@@ ji master@@ class sees them take gold
Great Britain &apos;s impressive run in the R@@ ug@@ by 7@@ s was brought to a cra@@ shing halt at the final hur@@ dle by Fi@@ ji in the final on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day night when they were compreh@@ en@@ sively beat@@ en 4@@ 3-@@ 7 at the De@@ od@@ or@@ o Sta@@ di@@ um here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji gave a master@@ class in handling , off-@@ lo@@ ading , si@@ de-@@ ste@@ pping , support play , running lines and bru@@ te strength to win gold - their first Olympic me@@ dal of any col@@ our .
De@@ feat came with the non-@@ too sha@@ b@@ by con@@ sol@@ ation of silver - Britain &apos;s third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the inaug@@ ural Olympic 7@@ s t@@ our@@ nam@@ ent in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa along the way .
The bru@@ ising beating of the Bo@@ ks , 7-@@ 5 in the semi-@@ final earlier in the day , may have come back to bite them in the final .
But , regardless , Fi@@ ji on this form would have beat@@ en a fit as a f@@ iddle 15-@@ man team .
It may be some con@@ sol@@ ation to GB - but probably not - that at least one Brit@@ on will have a gold me@@ dal around his nec@@ k tomorrow : Fi@@ ji &apos;s head co@@ ach is Ben Ryan , the former England bo@@ ss from W@@ im@@ b@@ led@@ on .
It has been some journey for GB .
E@@ ight years ago , under Ryan , they lost every game at the A@@ dela@@ ide S@@ ev@@ ens .
Here , they lost just one .
This ham@@ mer@@ ing will hurt but the progress is star@@ tling .
Fi@@ ji started magn@@ ific@@ ently , boun@@ cing off GB tack@@ les for fu@@ n .
It was like running into a series of moving bus@@ es for cap@@ tain To@@ m Mit@@ ch@@ ell and co and the World Ser@@ ies champions went 5-@@ 0 up when O@@ sea K@@ ol@@ in@@ is@@ au di@@ ved over in the corner .
With four minutes on the clock Jer@@ ry Tu@@ w@@ ai added another down the right wing , which was converted .
12@@ -0 and GB had hardly tou@@ ched the ball .
A super@@ b Mit@@ ch@@ ell tackle stopped the man-@@ mountain Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa from scor@@ ing a third but it was only delaying Fi@@ ji .
On seven minutes J@@ asa Ve@@ re@@ mal@@ ua tou@@ ched down in the right corner and GB were 17@@ -0 to the bad .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added another from the re@@ start and there was still over a minute on the clock ... in the first half .
V@@ at@@ em@@ o R@@ av@@ ou@@ vo@@ u then burst through some more lim@@ p GB tackling and stor@@ med to the line to score .
The conversion made it 29@@ -0 at the break .
It was as if Fi@@ ji had been born to play 7@@ s , while GB are still learning the trade .
Which is pretty much how it is .
GB made wholesale changes at half-@@ time and they pl@@ ug@@ ged the Fi@@ j@@ ian dam ... for all of four minutes , which by first-@@ half standards was good , until Jo@@ su@@ a Tu@@ iso@@ va went over after some brilliant Fi@@ j@@ ian inter@@ play .
Dan Nor@@ ton gra@@ bbed a try for GB , tou@@ ching down in the left corner to make it 3@@ 6-@@ 7 but the game was long gone the way of the South Sea Is@@ land@@ ers whose fans s@@ ang , wa@@ ved flag@@ s and dan@@ ced in the stands .
It was hard not to ad@@ mire Fi@@ ji &apos;s whole jo@@ y@@ ful approach .
M@@ ata V@@ ili@@ ame ic@@ ed the Fi@@ j@@ ian ca@@ ke that didn &apos;t need ic@@ ing with another try in the dying moments .
The wh@@ ist@@ le went , the Fi@@ ji@@ ans embraced and GB hit the tur@@ f , thoroughly beat@@ en .
Earlier in the day , Fi@@ ji had beat@@ en Japan 20-@@ 5 in their semi-@@ final and GB ed@@ ged South Africa in a tight semi-@@ final of one try each - Britain &apos;s conversion the difference .
Ky@@ le Brown put the Bo@@ ks ahead in the first half but Dan Nor@@ ton with some d@@ az@@ z@@ ling foot@@ work broke the line and scored under the posts in the second half .
A brilliant late tackle from Mar@@ c@@ us Wat@@ son , brother of England &apos;s 15-@@ aside team , An@@ th@@ ony , secured the win - and ultimately the silver me@@ dal .
He@@ len G@@ lo@@ ver and He@@ ather Stan@@ ning inspired to rowing victory by co@@ ach &apos;s cancer battle
There will not be a more emo@@ tive gold at these games , and that is saying something .
From the first stro@@ ke to the last , 2@@ 20 puni@@ shing he@@ a@@ ves into history , He@@ len G@@ lo@@ ver and He@@ ather Stan@@ ning found added meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ aci@@ o da L@@ ago@@ a .
Though they were the two pulling on the o@@ ars , there were three voices in that boat , the ech@@ o of co@@ ach Rob@@ in Willi@@ ams ever present as they powered to a second successive Olympic gold in the women &apos;s pa@@ irs , the first fem@@ ales in the ann@@ als of British sport to scale such a height .
Their dominance was absolute , after all this was their 39@@ th ou@@ ting un@@ beat@@ en , again unprecedented .
What we see , two brilliant athletes sk@@ ating over the surface with the e@@ leg@@ ance of sw@@ ans , does not wholly reflect the nature of the triumph .
Be@@ h@@ ind every rowing gold is a bat@@ tali@@ on of willing hands contributing the incremental gains that make the difference , and no hands were more instr@@ umental than those of a co@@ ach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see this day when diagnosed with cancer .
As he said , it was touch and go .
I had bl@@ ad@@ der cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they did .
If they don &apos;t it goes everywhere .
It would have been a pretty bad situation .
It al@@ ters your outlook a bit .
Willi@@ ams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
The tri@@ o were fortunate that he was able to begin his treatment at the start of 2014 out of season , keeping the disruption to a minimum , if that is ever the right expression in circumstances such as these .
I needed to get paid so I had to get better quickly .
It was an incentive .
I was in hospital and I was walking around the ward - 20@@ ft , 30@@ ft 50@@ ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is enough .
That &apos;s how it starts off .
R@@ owing in itself is a journey but that makes it a bit bigger .
In the immedi@@ acy of victory their first though@@ ts were for Willi@@ ams , who had spent a ner@@ vy morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to process his own anxie@@ ties .
Stan@@ ning , a cap@@ tain in the Royal Ar@@ til@@ l@@ ery regim@@ ent with a tour of Afghanistan behind her , said &quot; I &apos;@@ ve been an emotional wrec@@ k this week , maybe that &apos;s a bit extreme , but it means such a lot . &quot;
It just reiter@@ ates how much this means to me , how much me and He@@ len have worked and Rob@@ in as well .
It &apos;s been a fant@@ astic three years back with He@@ len and Rob@@ in .
Without Rob@@ in we would be nobody , so a massive thanks to him he &apos;s the best co@@ ach in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person to train with , or a better co@@ ach .
He@@ len G@@ lo@@ ver and He@@ ather Stan@@ ning haven &apos;t lost a race in five years .
The pa@@ ir set a puni@@ shing r@@ hy@@ th@@ m that their rivals could never match .
Even in the final 500 met@@ res when the cre@@ ws from New Zealand and Denmark began to close , Stan@@ ning and G@@ lo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
We were very much in the moment .
He@@ len was calling &apos; stay in the process , stay in the process &apos; .
It &apos;s really important not to get carried away .
We had a good start and at the same time we we@@ ren &apos;t looking to do anything amaz@@ ing .
We we@@ ren &apos;t looking for fire@@ works today , we were just looking to do a good row and to go out and win that race , which we did .
The pa@@ ir will take a year before deciding their futures .
G@@ lo@@ ver has a we@@ d@@ ding to attend next month , her own to television advent@@ u@@ rer Ste@@ ve B@@ ack@@ shall .
For now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say this was my last race .
That would have meant too much pressure .
In London it took about six months to reali@@ se that I was an Olympic champion .
It was all so new and I was so stressed .
Here it took about four minutes .
This feels so much better , &quot; she said .

Bulgaria Po@@ sts Inflation for 1@@ st Time in 8 Mon@@ ths
Inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July , national statistics show .
This is the highest value in years ( since June 2012 ) and the first one above zero since October of last year when a positive 0.2 % was po@@ sted .
The annual average inflation , measured by CPI , in the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.@@ 0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.@@ 0 % .
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) has been -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
In July 2016 , compared to the previous month , an increase was observed in the price of the following groups of consumer goods : food and non-@@ alco@@ holi@@ c be@@ ver@@ ages ( 1.7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; rec@@ re@@ ation and culture ( 6.@@ 3 % ) ; restaurants and hot@@ els ( 1.2 % ) ; mis@@ cel@@ lan@@ eous goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
Pri@@ ces decreased in clothing and foot@@ wear ( 2.2 % ) ; fur@@ ni@@ sh@@ ings , household equipment and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
Pri@@ ces remained at the same level as in the previous month in alco@@ holi@@ c be@@ ver@@ ages and tobacco ; housing , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communications ; and education .
S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at &quot; An@@ im@@ e &quot; Eff@@ ect Is Cri@@ tici@@ zed as Asian Car@@ ic@@ ature
S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at says this fil@@ ter is inspired by anim@@ e , but some observers say it &apos;s rac@@ ially in@@ sensitive .
With its l@@ ens tool , S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at allows some 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absurd .
You can turn yourself into a p@@ ine@@ ap@@ ple , a dog or a character be@@ f@@ itting a Ro@@ y L@@ ich@@ ten@@ stein pain@@ ting .
The len@@ ses are blunt , feat@@ u@@ re-@@ war@@ ping tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced sel@@ fies a day .
Any mis@@ steps quickly enter the public record .
S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at len@@ ses have drawn criticism in the past with accusations that the ap@@ p was promoting black@@ face or encouraging wh@@ it@@ ened skin t@@ ones as an ideal of beauty .
So when it pushed a l@@ ens to some users this week that gave them s@@ lan@@ ted eyes , distorted te@@ eth and pu@@ ff@@ y che@@ e@@ ks , some critics called it a racist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asian people - &quot; yel@@ low@@ face . &quot;
And they won@@ dered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
The news and the outrage went wide on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day , with reports by The Ver@@ ge and M@@ other@@ board , a day after S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at said it had disman@@ tled the feature .
The company offered an explanation : The l@@ ens was meant as hom@@ age to anim@@ e charac@@ ters , not as a car@@ ic@@ ature of Asian people .
But for observers who have experienced racism , the l@@ ens reminded them of hur@@ tful stere@@ otyp@@ es in action .
Others r@@ oundly rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
In an em@@ ail , G@@ race S@@ par@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean American art student whose twe@@ et about the pho@@ tos was widely shared , said that the l@@ ens was &quot; hur@@ tful and uncomfortable to say the least . &quot;
She added that &quot; it &apos;s hard to argue with the side by side comparison of the very gross Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the fil@@ ter &apos;s effects .
It shows that the fil@@ ter isn &apos;t just yel@@ low@@ face , but yel@@ low@@ face taken to its der@@ og@@ atory extreme .
S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at is not the only company to cross these cultural tri@@ p@@ wi@@ res .
American culture seems involved in an endless struggle over diversity and inclusion , from corporate bo@@ ar@@ dro@@ oms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands .
And S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at &apos;s huge audience of younger people - who are more rac@@ ially diverse than their older counterparts - might mean that they are even more likely to expect sensitivity .
When one of S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at &apos;s len@@ ses creates an image that is insul@@ ting to a user , 25@@ -year-old K@@ ati@@ e Z@@ hu said in an interview on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day , &quot; it &apos;s much harder for these types of things to go un@@ noticed like they did before . &quot;
On Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day , M@@ s. Z@@ hu , a product manag@@ er and engineer who works for Me@@ di@@ um , decided to de@@ le@@ te her S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at account and encouraged others to do the same .
In an ess@@ ay for Me@@ di@@ um and in a telephone interview , she said she believed that the rac@@ e-@@ related controversi@@ es reflected a lack of diversity in hiring practices at S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at .
M@@ s. Z@@ hu criticized the company &apos;s mostly white , all-@@ male leadership and ended her ess@@ ay with a ha@@ sh@@ ta@@ g : # De@@ le@@ te@@ S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at .
&quot; It &apos;s either that they had no diverse representation of people of color on their staff to the point where they &apos;@@ re able to make decisions like this , &quot; M@@ s. Z@@ hu , who is Chinese-@@ American , said , &quot; or they do have some people of color who are working there , but they &apos;@@ re not on positions where they feel safe or comfortable to speak up . &quot;
Other observers share her view , a compla@@ int that S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at has left largely un@@ answered .
The company does not release figures about diversity on its staff , noting its status as a private company .
On Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day , S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at declined to discuss the racial back@@ grounds of its staff , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hi@@ red a recruit@@ er to focus on under@@ represented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally .
For her part , M@@ s. Z@@ hu said she would keep her S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at account closed , adding , &quot; I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O@@ .@@ K@@ . &quot;
Military Offici@@ als Dist@@ or@@ ted ISIS Intelligence , Congressional Panel S@@ ays
Offici@@ als from the United States Central Comm@@ and altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground warranted , a congressional panel said in a report issued Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day .
The interim report , from a task force established by the Republican cha@@ ir@@ men of the House Armed Services Committee , Intelligence Committee and Defense Ap@@ propri@@ ations Sub@@ committee , found &quot; widespread dis@@ satisfaction &quot; among Central Comm@@ and intelligence analysts , who said superi@@ ors were doc@@ tor@@ ing their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State .
Central Comm@@ and , known as Cent@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , F@@ la . , that over@@ sees American military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; Intelligence products approved by senior Cent@@ com leaders typically provided a more positive depic@@ tion of U@@ .@@ S. anti@@ terrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community , &quot; a news release about the report said .
&quot; What happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers , &quot; said Representative K@@ en Cal@@ vert , Republican of California .
The leadership failures at Cent@@ com reach to the very top of the organization .
The 10-@@ page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Comm@@ and &apos;s description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces .
Although it offers no defin@@ itive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be doc@@ to@@ red , it describes analysts as feeling as though they were under pressure from Cent@@ com leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ I@@ L .
&quot; Throughout the first half of 2015 , many Central Comm@@ and press rele@@ ases , statements and congressional testim@@ on@@ ies were significantly more positive than actual events , &quot; the report said .
For example , a Cent@@ com official stated publicly that a major military assault to take back Mo@@ su@@ l could begin as early as April or May 2015 .
Mo@@ su@@ l , Iraq &apos;s second-largest city , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; After months of investigation , this much is very clear , &quot; Representative Mi@@ ke P@@ om@@ pe@@ o , Republican of K@@ an@@ s@@ as , said in a statement .
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the United States Central Comm@@ and &apos;s most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command &apos;s intelligence products to down@@ play the threat from ISIS in Iraq .
Republicans created the task force after learning that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipulated .
The report released Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues .
There is an additional , ongoing investigation of Cent@@ com intelligence by the Department of Defense inspec@@ tor general .
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force .
&quot; Between 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com created an overly insul@@ ar process for producing intelligence assessments on IS@@ I@@ L and Iraqi Security Forces , &quot; Representative Adam B@@ . Sch@@ i@@ ff , the committee &apos;s top Democrat , said in a statement .
This process , M@@ r. Sch@@ i@@ ff said , &quot; stalled the release of intelligence products , &quot; hurt mor@@ ale among analysts and &quot; in@@ sufficiently accommo@@ dated dis@@ s@@ enting views . &quot;
But M@@ r. Sch@@ i@@ ff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Cent@@ com analysts to fit their conclusions to a &quot; pre@@ set or political narrative . &quot;
The pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary results of the congressional investigation were reported Tu@@ es@@ day by The D@@ aily Be@@ ast .
Last August , The New York Times reported the existence of the Pent@@ agon inspec@@ tor general investigation , opened after complaints by Cent@@ com analysts .
L@@ t@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Pat@@ ric@@ k Ev@@ ans , a Pent@@ agon spokes@@ man , said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report while the inspec@@ tor general &apos;s investigation continued .
But he said that &quot; experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data , and the intelligence community and Department of Defense welcome healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics . &quot;
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of whether the American-@@ led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding ( an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense officials ) .
But last year &apos;s allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Comm@@ and for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis spots .
The criti@@ ques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago , when a Cent@@ com intelligence analy@@ st , G@@ reg@@ ory Ho@@ o@@ ker , wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bush , over many analysts &quot; objections , advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion .
M@@ r. Ho@@ o@@ ker also played a key part in the insur@@ rec@@ tion over the Islamic State intelligence .
Last year , officials said , M@@ r. Ho@@ o@@ ker &apos;s team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary , air@@ strikes against Islamic St@@ ate-@@ held refin@@ eries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group &apos;s finances because it had built make@@ shift refin@@ eries to sell oil on the black market .
But the finding was not distributed outside Central Comm@@ and , The Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com &apos;s commander then , Gen@@ . L@@ loy@@ d J. A@@ us@@ tin III , came under criticism last year after Senate testimony viewed by many lawmakers as being an overly positive assessment of the war .
General A@@ us@@ tin retired in April and was replaced at Central Comm@@ and by Gen@@ . Joseph L@@ . Vo@@ tel .
U@@ .@@ S. W@@ ins 4@@ th Stra@@ ight in Women &apos;s F@@ ield H@@ oc@@ key , Se@@ tting Up Sh@@ ow@@ down With Britain
One day after scor@@ ing three goals in a 6-@@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ ati@@ e B@@ am scored the first two goals for the United States women &apos;s field ho@@ c@@ key team on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day as the Americans defeated India , 3-@@ 0 .
Five goals in two games should be a mem@@ orable feat , but B@@ am , 27 , said she was not sure if she had ever done the same thing .
&quot; I have no clu@@ e , &quot; she said .
I &apos;@@ m not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals .
Here is what she does know : The Americans are 4-@@ 0 in the Olympic t@@ our@@ nam@@ ent and are tied for first place in their group with Britain , which remained un@@ beat@@ en after defeating Japan , 2-@@ 0 , on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day .
Britain and the United States will meet on S@@ atur@@ day in the last game of the first round .
Both teams have qualified for the quarter fin@@ als , and the game will decide who fin@@ i@@ shes first in their six-@@ team brac@@ ket and who fin@@ i@@ shes second .
The first-@@ place fin@@ i@@ sher will avoid the powerful Dutch , the leaders of the other brac@@ ket , for a bit longer when the quarter fin@@ als begin .
However S@@ atur@@ day &apos;s game turns out , the Americans have created a sti@@ r with their surprising run here , four years after fin@@ ishing last among 12 teams at the London Games .
B@@ am was on that team .
She grew up in Blu@@ e B@@ ell , P@@ a . , first picked up a field ho@@ c@@ key stick when she was 3 ( her twin older sist@@ ers played the sport at Dre@@ x@@ el ) and joined the national team when she was 16 , becoming its youn@@ gest player ever .
She missed out on the 2008 Olympics when she did not make the cut for the final ro@@ ster .
Then came 2012 , when nothing much went right for her and her te@@ amm@@ ates .
The next year , C@@ ra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Eng@@ li@@ sh@@ man , was named the co@@ ach , and things began to change .
&quot; A cultural change , a mental change , a physical change , &quot; B@@ am said .
We didn &apos;t have the work rate in London that we have now .
We &apos;@@ ve made a complete turn@@ around .
On Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day night , B@@ am opened the scor@@ ing in the first half with a back@@ hand shot from close in .
India had come into the game without a victory in the t@@ our@@ nam@@ ent , but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-@@ 0 until late in the third period , when B@@ am took charge .
She made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field , then cur@@ led into the middle and wh@@ i@@ pped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-@@ 0 lead .
M@@ eli@@ ss@@ a G@@ on@@ z@@ al@@ ez added the final goal mid@@ way through the fourth period .
The shut@@ out was the first of the t@@ our@@ nam@@ ent for the United States go@@ ali@@ e , Jack@@ ie Bri@@ g@@ gs , who had allowed one goal in each of the first three victories .
She is on a roll .
So is B@@ am .
&quot; We &apos;@@ re in a good place right now , &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham said , but just how good it is will depend on the result of S@@ atur@@ day &apos;s game .

&quot; It was an act of cul@@ inary solidarity with the people who were suffering , &quot; Jan@@ e Z@@ ie@@ g@@ el@@ man said .
Her husband , Andrew Co@@ e , added , &quot; It was also a message to Americans about how to eat . &quot;
The couple , who live in B@@ roo@@ k@@ l@@ yn He@@ ights , are food historians .
M@@ r. Co@@ e &apos;s last book , &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey , &quot; was about Chinese cu@@ is@@ ine in America , while M@@ s. Z@@ ie@@ g@@ el@@ man told the story of life in a L@@ ower East S@@ ide ten@@ ement through food in her book &quot; 97 Or@@ ch@@ ard . &quot;
Their new , collaborative work , &quot; A Square Me@@ al , &quot; which will be published Tu@@ es@@ day by Har@@ per , is a history of American food in the Great Depression .
Sh@@ owing some cul@@ inary solidarity of their own , they met a repor@@ ter for din@@ ner at Eis@@ en@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ w@@ ich Sho@@ p , a tiny no-@@ fri@@ l@@ ls lun@@ ch counter in the F@@ l@@ ati@@ ron district that has been in business since the year of the crash , 1929 .
M@@ s. Z@@ ie@@ g@@ el@@ man , 54 , ordered a cre@@ am che@@ ese and ch@@ op@@ ped oli@@ ve s@@ and@@ w@@ ich , while M@@ r. Co@@ e , 57 , had the tur@@ key , mas@@ h@@ ed pot@@ ato@@ es and vege@@ table me@@ d@@ ley .
When a repor@@ ter ordered me@@ at@@ lo@@ af , the couple deemed it f@@ itting for a discussion of De@@ pres@@ sion-@@ era eating .
&quot; Lo@@ a@@ ves were very popular , &quot; M@@ s. Z@@ ie@@ g@@ el@@ man said .
There was pe@@ an@@ ut lo@@ af , liver lo@@ af , bean lo@@ af .
They were made from an ingredi@@ ent and a cheap thing that stret@@ ches the ingredi@@ ent out .
Imagine eating enough pe@@ anu@@ ts to serve as your din@@ ner .
M@@ r. Co@@ e gri@@ mac@@ ed .
&quot; It must have sat in your stom@@ ach like lead , &quot; he said .
In the years before the Depression , the American table , especially in rural areas , was an all-@@ you@@ -@@ can@@ -@@ eat buff@@ et .
Te@@ ams of women co@@ o@@ ked for male farm@@ workers , and fre@@ sh-@@ b@@ aked pie was served at break@@ fast , lun@@ ch and din@@ ner .
It was Americans who had sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during World War I@@ . &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; chron@@ ic@@ les the ways the nation cop@@ ed with suddenly not being the land of plenty .
&quot; This was a time when food became a central , fraught subject for the American people , &quot; M@@ r. Co@@ e said , explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
Equally fraught was the new budget diet : My@@ ster@@ y di@@ shes like lo@@ a@@ ves and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became st@@ ap@@ les , the c@@ asser@@ o@@ le a &quot; won@@ der@@ ful way to re@@ purpose lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; M@@ s. Z@@ ie@@ g@@ el@@ man noted , because co@@ o@@ ks could hide un@@ appe@@ tiz@@ ing ingredients under a cre@@ am@@ y co@@ ating of s@@ au@@ ce .
F@@ resh fruit was replaced with cheaper dri@@ ed fruit .
Me@@ at , for years the center of the American me@@ al , became a spar@@ ingly ap@@ por@@ tioned luxury .
S@@ tran@@ ge mas@@ hu@@ ps were tried as cal@@ or@@ ic and nutri@@ tional fulfill@@ ment took precedent over taste or even common kit@@ ch@@ en sense .
In research@@ ing the book , which includes reci@@ pes , M@@ s. Z@@ ie@@ g@@ el@@ man prepared a period dish of b@@ aked on@@ ion stu@@ ff@@ ed with pe@@ an@@ ut but@@ ter .
&quot; It was not a popular addition to the din@@ ner table , &quot; M@@ r. Co@@ e said .
M@@ s. Z@@ ie@@ g@@ el@@ man amp@@ lified : &quot; It was sur@@ real . &quot;
Pe@@ an@@ ut but@@ ter has nothing to say to a b@@ aked on@@ ion .
It was characteristic of a lot of the home@@ -@@ e@@ c reci@@ pes .
As never before or since , home economists - among them Lou@@ ise Stanley , chief of the federal Bu@@ reau of Home Economics from 19@@ 23 to 194@@ 3 - drove the country &apos;s eating habits .
Publi@@ shing reci@@ pes and articles in newspapers and magaz@@ ines , they encouraged women to become &quot; budge@@ te@@ ers &quot; and rise to the challenge of transforming glo@@ p like cre@@ amed sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i with car@@ ro@@ ts into tast@@ y di@@ shes .
&quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; is a fe@@ ast of historical tid@@ bits .
E@@ sp@@ ecially sav@@ ory are the accounts of the government &apos;s response to its hungry citizen@@ ry , like President Her@@ bert Ho@@ over &apos;s le@@ t-@@ me@@ -@@ e@@ at-@@ ca@@ ke attitude .
While he publicly praised the simple I@@ ow@@ a farm@@ house co@@ oking of his childhood , he d@@ ined like the m@@ illion@@ aire sophistic@@ ate he had become .
&quot; He liked to eat Contin@@ ental cu@@ is@@ ine , like fish with c@@ uc@@ um@@ ber s@@ au@@ ce , &quot; M@@ r. Co@@ e said .
He ate in almost a gol@@ d-@@ pl@@ ated din@@ ing room , wearing a din@@ ner jac@@ ket .
He was fab@@ ul@@ ously out of touch .
President Roosevelt may have committed the same error if his wife , E@@ lean@@ or , had not encouraged him to set an example with his stom@@ ach .
As the book tells it , M@@ r@@ s. Roosevelt &apos;s hiring of a house@@ keep@@ er with no interest in fla@@ v@@ or resulted in a White House that &quot; put out not only some of the dre@@ ari@@ est food in Washington but also some of the most dis@@ m@@ ally prepared . &quot;
Many of the De@@ pres@@ sion-@@ era food ways were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet .
The legacy is in our continued focus on cal@@ ories and nutrition , M@@ s. Z@@ ie@@ g@@ el@@ man said , and on the way science has been applied to co@@ oking .
The couple said that in writing the book , they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of M@@ s. Z@@ ie@@ g@@ el@@ man &apos;s mother - how she couldn &apos;t throw food away , for instance .
&quot; She had a real fear of food waste , &quot; M@@ r. Co@@ e said .
M@@ s. Z@@ ie@@ g@@ el@@ man rec@@ alled : &quot; She actually got people sick . &quot;
There was the cre@@ am@@ -@@ pu@@ ff incident .
After the pl@@ ates were cle@@ ared at Eis@@ en@@ berg &apos;s , she and M@@ r. Co@@ e pulled out a de@@ s@@ ser@@ t they had prepared at home : the p@@ run@@ e de@@ s@@ ser@@ t that President Roosevelt ate for lun@@ ch .
&quot; It &apos;s called p@@ run@@ e wh@@ i@@ p , &quot; M@@ s. Z@@ ie@@ g@@ el@@ man said , adding that a common trick was to give modest reci@@ pes a sn@@ az@@ zy name .
There was no wh@@ i@@ pped cre@@ am , just p@@ run@@ es , a little bit of fl@@ our , sugar , water and cin@@ nam@@ on .
Everyone reluc@@ tan@@ tly di@@ pped a spo@@ on into the vi@@ sc@@ ous b@@ rown go@@ o .
Sur@@ pris@@ ingly , it wasn &apos;t bad .
M@@ r. Co@@ e went back for secon@@ ds , and thirds .
S@@ ounding like a can@@ -@@ do budge@@ ter , he told his wife , &quot; Some ch@@ op@@ ped wal@@ nu@@ ts would help . &quot;
Unfortunately , OPEC &apos;s latest monthly report shows that the crude oil production in July continued to increase and Saudi Arabia &apos;s output hit a new high .
The report cannot prevent the market from doub@@ ting the credibility of OPEC . Oil recovery path is still bri@@ st@@ led with thor@@ ns .
On Mon@@ day , OPEC Chairman and Qatar Energy Minister S@@ ada said OPEC will hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on September 26@@ -@@ 28 .
The monthly report of OPEC on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day showed that the output of the entire OPEC organization in July , including G@@ ab@@ on , increased by 4@@ 6,000 bar@@ rels / day to 3@@ 3.@@ 11 million bar@@ rels / day .
OPEC also said in a monthly report that low crude oil prices have prompted global refin@@ ers to produce more refin@@ ed oil , thus increasing the degree of excess supply to the market .
Aff@@ ected by this news , coupled with the production output expectations of rising crude oil and the unexpected increase in crude oil invent@@ ories , aggrav@@ ating the excessive market supply .
As of W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day &apos;s close , the light crude oil futures of New York Mer@@ can@@ tile Exchange fell by 2.@@ 48 % in September and the future price of crude oil in October in London B@@ rent fell by 2.@@ 0@@ 7 % .
Re@@ u@@ ters believes that the proposed meeting of the oil-@@ producing countries is unlikely to tighten the supply . The data released by US Energy Information Administration also suppress the market sentiment .
Iran &apos;s official news agency F@@ ars on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day , qu@@ oting the speech of Z@@ ang@@ an@@ eh , Iranian oil minister , said that Iran &apos;s daily crude oil production was up to 3.@@ 85 million bar@@ rels , which has been the highest level since 2008 .
At the release of the news of the meeting , the Russian energy minister Nov@@ ak said that it was unnecessary to conduct a new round of frozen production negotiations under the current oil price .
It was April when the oil-@@ producing countries had meeting . No agreement was reached among the OPEC member countries .
Em@@ ma Ric@@ har@@ ds , an oil and gas analy@@ st at B@@ MI@@ Research , said the market and the media could react excessively to OPEC &apos;s meeting .
He@@ lim@@ a Cro@@ ft , head of commodity strategy at Royal Bank of Canada , said OPEC changed the market sentiment by rele@@ asing signals that they would make an agreement .
This means like a smo@@ ke and a mirror that draws people &apos;s attention ( deliberately giving a false impression ) .
E@@ ug@@ en We@@ in@@ berg , director of commodity research at the German commercial bank , said the possibility of OPEC trying to stabilize the market through the September meeting was low .
This is likely to further undermine the market confidence in OPEC . After all , this organization already staged a &quot; w@@ olf is coming &quot; .
All loc@@ alities should take medical institutions which have illegal medical advertising , complaints focusing on the past and have repeatedly been punished as a focus of inspec@@ tion .
National Health Commission and the State Administration of Tra@@ ditional Chinese Medic@@ ine will timely carry out supervision on the supervision and inspec@@ tion work of some provinces .
According to media disclosure , the large influx of capital into the Internet medicine has resulted in the serious problem of current product homo@@ gene@@ ity . Investment boom f@@ ade gradually and capital came into the wa@@ it-@@ and-@@ see period .
According to the data of Hong Kong A@@ i Li P@@ i Ho@@ sp@@ ital Management Research Center , a large number of start-@@ up Internet medical companies langu@@ ished just within one year and about 20 % of the start-@@ up Internet medical companies has ce@@ ased to exist .
However , just as the majority of Internet medical companies struggle in the road of A round or B round of financing , several sub-@@ areas leading enterprises can still get the capital tou@@ ted .
It seems that the Internet medical business shall not &quot; s@@ warm &quot; , but to see the needs of the market , and be professional and profound .
Yu@@ y@@ ue invested 12 million y@@ uan , accounting for 40 % of the registered capital , while Ji@@ u@@ zh@@ out@@ ong invested 18 million y@@ uan , accounting for 60 % of the registered capital .
In recent years , with the country providing policy support in the medical information , electronic and integrated supply chain management system gradually enter the hospitals at all levels .
The cooperation between Yu@@ y@@ ue and Ji@@ u@@ zh@@ out@@ ong is aimed at the needs of the market , helping the hospital to build advanced supply chain management system , and take this opportunity to seek more cooperation .
Unlike many Internet medical companies which go in for gran@@ di@@ ose projects , i@@ B@@ ab@@ y focuses on the Internet ob@@ ste@@ tri@@ cs ver@@ tical field and be professional on pregnant mothers and doctors .
P@@ reg@@ n@@ ant women can not only enjoy 24 hours of medical services free of charge and one-@@ on-@@ one inquiry with doctors , but also pay for medical coun@@ sel@@ ing .
At the doctor &apos;s side , i@@ B@@ ab@@ y breaks the geographical restrictions by taking the form of organizing experts to give grassroots doctors an online l@@ ecture , peer exchange , case discussion and so on .
At present , three pl@@ ates are set up for doctor &apos;s cli@@ ent side , respectively , for doctors to continue education , social exchange and communication .
The following services are provided , including online learning , case discussion and academic exchange ; social platform for the exchange of doctors of the same hospital and department ; legal assistance , business support and other services required by doc@@ tor-@@ patient relationship or personal life .
According to media reports , CEO W@@ ang Le@@ i recently said Ali health &quot; is willing to get down &quot; to win big health data .
Internet companies and data companies are short of profession@@ alism . No unity can be provided on the same entry .
The lay@@ out of Ali in the medical and health field is divided into three pl@@ ates , namely , Ali Health , L@@ yn@@ x P@@ harm@@ acy and Ali@@ pay future hospital .
W@@ ang Le@@ i admitted that it was more difficult for medical and health companies to start up than other industries , &quot; This is not just how much money you have . In addition , it requires people to be concentrated on it and endure the l@@ on@@ el@@ iness .
Sta@@ ying up late watching the Olympic Games will damage the heart easily
Brazil Olympic Games is in full swing . Even if the event is broadcast in the mid@@ night in China , many people will stay up late to watch .
In this regard , the doctor reminded that staying up late has health risks and may lead to cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular disease .
If you stay up for a long time , the hor@@ m@@ one will have a lot of secre@@ tion and your body will continue to be in a state of intense excitement and cannot have normal recovery . This may easily cause v@@ as@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tion , blood pressure and thus cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular disease .
H@@ an Z@@ hi@@ y@@ uan reminded people who have high blood pressure , high blood sugar , high blood li@@ pi@@ ds , smoking habits , family history and other cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular risk factors may easily suffer from cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular disease if staying up late .
If you stay up late , then your cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular function will be affected , your g@@ ast@@ ro@@ inte@@ st@@ inal function , immune system , neuro@@ en@@ doc@@ rine system will also be affected , and even the risk of cancer will increase .
For old friends , H@@ an Z@@ hi@@ y@@ uan suggested them better not stay up late to watch games , particularly those with cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular disease .
During the last &quot; World Cup &quot; football match , H@@ an Z@@ hi@@ y@@ uan received a 60@@ -year-old patient . His onset of my@@ oc@@ ar@@ di@@ al inf@@ ar@@ c@@ tion may be related with staying up late to watch games .
According to H@@ an Z@@ hi@@ y@@ uan , his department had treated some 25@@ -year-old my@@ oc@@ ar@@ di@@ al inf@@ ar@@ c@@ tion or stro@@ ke patients . This is largely due to long-term stay up of patients .
1 . Do not stay up late every day . You can occasionally stay up all night watching the favorite sports and watch the re@@ broadcast for other sports next day .
2 . You may d@@ rink more water , have more fruit during stay up as this can prevent blood clo@@ gging and enhance your body immunity .

The film is expected to first show on CC@@ TV and Le@@ t@@ v in the early next year . A V@@ R pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic docum@@ entary version will also be launched for the first time .
The docum@@ entary &quot; Pol@@ ar &quot; is a large-scale work that focuses on the world &apos;s third po@@ le , Q@@ ing@@ ha@@ i-@@ Tibet Pl@@ ate@@ au . It tells a story for the integration of Tibetan tradition and the modern world and the interaction between Tibet and the world from a new perspective .
The biggest advantage for V@@ R works is to enable the audience to have a unique movie watching &quot; im@@ mer@@ sion &quot; and this also raise a higher request for the shooting process .
The production team of &quot; Pol@@ ar &quot; Pan@@ or@@ ama V@@ R special e@@ dition said that they will ensure that every aspect of the scre@@ en is imp@@ ec@@ cable and let the audiences have sen@@ ses of im@@ mer@@ sive .
On August 11 , the Armed Poli@@ ce Sh@@ and@@ ong Cor@@ ps Y@@ an@@ tai de@@ t@@ achment organized special war s@@ ni@@ p@@ ers to have j@@ ung@@ le training at K@@ uny@@ u Moun@@ tain under the high temperature of 34 degrees Celsius .
During the Cold War , the Soviet Union trans@@ ported the missile into Cuba , which almost led to the US-@@ Soviet nuclear war .
This event was seen as the pin@@ n@@ acle of the cold war , known as the &quot; Cuban missile crisis . &quot;
But what is little known is that during the Cold War , a strong solar storm has almost led to a nuclear war of the United States against the Soviet Union . The incident has not been announced by the researchers until August 9 .
On May 23 , 1967 , a strong solar storm caused strong interference to the ra@@ dar and radio communications of the US military in the Arctic .
These ra@@ d@@ ars were part of the ballistic missile early warning system of the US , used for monitoring Soviet missiles .
This paper was written by researchers at the University of Col@@ or@@ ado , who inter@@ viewed US military personnel involved in the forecasting and analysis of solar activity and reviewed non-@@ confid@@ ential documents .
The paper wrote that in the 1960s , in order to prevent the Soviet Union from suddenly launching nuclear war , the US Air Force has always had some fighters with nuclear war@@ heads flying in the sky .
US military comman@@ ders did not know that the cul@@ pri@@ t of the interference was the solar storm rather than the Soviet Union , so they ordered the fighters to enter combat readiness state .
Fortunately , the US military force had started the study of solar activities and its elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic interference to the Earth since the 1950s , it ultimately stopped this potential military conflict .
Later , he sum@@ mar@@ ized the information provided by the US Air Force Air Me@@ te@@ or@@ ological Service and submitted a detailed report .
The direct consequence of this solar storm is that the US military has seen space weather as a combat concern and has built a stronger space weather forecast system .
During daily travel , when citizens found that their cars were ham@@ pered by a strange vehicle , they may use &quot; We@@ Ch@@ at vehicle moving &quot; function to solve this problem when they failed to contact with the strange vehicle driver .
From August 11 , Xi &apos;@@ an traffic police We@@ Ch@@ at service number &quot; Xi &apos;@@ an traffic police &quot; launched &quot; We@@ Ch@@ at vehicle moving &quot; service .
After the launching of this service , during daily life , when the citizens found their cars were ham@@ pered by un@@ familiar vehicles , the driver of which is not at the scene , they may solve the problems via &quot; We@@ Ch@@ at &quot; function .
The new service has many functions , the first of which is fast efficiency , saving administrative costs ; the second is resp@@ ecting and protecting the privacy of citizens ; and the third is all-@@ weather and full-time service .
Citizens can operate it quite conveni@@ ently with their We@@ Ch@@ at . Such method enables the both sides to meet in a friendly and easy way and allevi@@ ates and sol@@ ves the problem of difficulty of par@@ king and reduces the oc@@ curren@@ ce rate of car@@ -related public security cases .
On the other hand , for those who refuse to move and have illegal par@@ king or ob@@ struction , Xi &apos;@@ an traffic control department said the traffic police will take different measures to handle the actual situation based on the actual situation .
On August 9 , in the Di@@ hu@@ a town cultural tourism scen@@ ic spots of Dan@@ f@@ en@@ g Coun@@ ty , more than 10 young workers of Shang@@ lu@@ o power supply company came here to carry out the &quot; introduce electricity activity in the ancient town &quot; and Dou@@ ble S@@ event@@ h F@@ es@@ tiv@@ al theme activities .

&quot; This time the company has provided us with such a rela@@ xed , happy and harmon@@ ious platform . I really like it , meaningful and interesting . &quot;
Dou@@ ble S@@ event@@ h F@@ es@@ tiv@@ al theme activities have won wide acc@@ laim of youth staff at the scene . They hope that the company would later organize such activities , and strengthen communication and exchange with more other young people .

On April 27 , 2015 , the United States and Japan jointly issued a new version of &quot; US-@@ Japan defense cooperation guidelines &quot; in New York , allowing the Japanese armed forces to play a more offensive role in the world .
This is the day the US Defense Secretary Carter , US Secretary of State Kerry , Japanese Foreign Minister F@@ um@@ i@@ o Ki@@ sh@@ ida and Japan &apos;s Minister of Defense G@@ en N@@ ak@@ at@@ ani attended the press conference in New York .
This is the fifth time that China &apos;s civilian think tank has published the Japanese military assessment report and the fourth launch of the English version .
The report is divided into nine chap@@ ters , including the overall policy adjustment , military strength , defense budget , military deployment , weapons and equipment , military system reform , military training , foreign military security cooperation and military security relations with China and so on .
The report said that the year 2015 is a phased last year of the Abe government to promote major policy adjustments in the security area .
Since then , Japan &apos;s initiatives in the field of security will be mainly in the legal system , strategy implementation , policy implementation and other operational level , rather than the substantial adjustments and changes of framework , mechanisms and policies .
The report emphasized that the Abe C@@ ab@@ inet tried to break through the above three points to achieve the promotion of Japan &apos;s &quot; normal nation@@ alization &quot; , and the go@@ ing-@@ out of militia to intervene in international security affairs , strengthen Jap@@ an-@@ US alliance and prevent the rise of China and resist China .
Pre@@ viously , the China Strategy and Cul@@ ture Pro@@ motion Council released the Japanese military assessment report on June 5 , 2012 , July 19 , 2013 , July 23 , 2014 and June 30 , 2015 .
British &quot; Financial Times &quot; on August 12 released a group of pic@@ tures on man@@ sion of US ambassador to China .
According to the article , in contrast , the appearance of the American ambassador &apos;s resid@@ ence , from the appearance of view , can be used as safety house in the cold war sp@@ y no@@ v@@ els of John le Car@@ r@@ é .
The resid@@ ence is gra@@ y , and strongly for@@ tified by peripheral f@@ ence , the second interior wall , bar@@ bed w@@ ire entang@@ lement and vehicle road@@ blocks .
Im@@ pro@@ vement of public sports facilities
Dar@@ k coal field w@@ are@@ house is turned into a &quot; green gra@@ ss &quot; football field while red b@@ ric@@ k sp@@ ire plant is turned into a modern sports mu@@ seum .
On the national fit@@ ness day , N@@ an@@ lu@@ o May@@ ing S@@ ports Cul@@ ture Park , outside the H@@ ang@@ zhou W@@ ang@@ jiang gate , unveiled its myster@@ ious ve@@ il .
It was a coal field once and remained id@@ le for more than 10 years after its closure . A large number of illegal construction and gar@@ b@@ age were left behind .
After the re@@ no@@ vation , it became a sports and cultural par@@ k , and will be officially opened in November to the public free of charge to provide sports ven@@ ues . In addition , it would undoubtedly open up a new fertile soil for the whole people .
This reminds people of H@@ ang@@ zhou Chen J@@ ing@@ lu@@ n School . This is a &quot; W@@ ham@@ po@@ a Military Academy &quot; in China &apos;s sw@@ im@@ ming world , in which several world champions were born .
Sw@@ im@@ ming champions will be produced continu@@ ously , producing a vivi@@ d interpretation of the relationship between competitive sports and national sports . The profound mass base provided a good condition for sel@@ ecting professional players .
The level of competitive sports is closely related to the foundation of national sports . Ath@@ le@@ tic sports depend in a certain sense on national sports , and national sports depend on the conditions of the site .
According to reports , as of 2015 , the area of China &apos;s per capita sports ven@@ ues has been 150 times of that when the new China was established , but still far behind the sports power .
In June this year , the State Council issued a &quot; National F@@ it@@ ness Program ( 2016 - 2020 ) &quot; and took the development of mass sports as a key content .
In order to fill the short board , on the one hand , the relevant departments shall take full account of the lay@@ out of the st@@ adi@@ um at urban planning .
On the other hand , the already built public sports ven@@ ues , including schools and other units in the sports ven@@ ues , should try to expand the scope of openness and try to improve efficiency as much as possible .
The Rio Olympic Games , which is in full swing , has stimul@@ ated people &apos;s enthusiasm for sports , but also ar@@ oused everyone &apos;s awareness of participation .
G@@ ile@@ ad to get att@@ or@@ ney fees in he@@ pati@@ tis C patent fight with Mer@@ ck
G@@ ile@@ ad Sciences In@@ c is entitled to receive the att@@ or@@ ney fees it incurred related to he@@ pati@@ tis C patent li@@ tig@@ ation with dru@@ g@@ maker Mer@@ ck &amp; C@@ o In@@ c , a U@@ .@@ S. district judge has ruled .
In June , G@@ ile@@ ad was fre@@ ed from paying up $ 200 million in dam@@ ages for inf@@ r@@ inging two Mer@@ ck patents related to G@@ ile@@ ad &apos;s block@@ bu@@ ster drugs So@@ val@@ di and Harv@@ on@@ i , after a U@@ .@@ S. judge found a pattern of mis@@ conduct by Mer@@ ck including lying under o@@ ath and other un@@ ethical practices .
In a fil@@ ing on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day , U@@ .@@ S. Dist@@ ric@@ t Jud@@ ge Be@@ th L@@ abs@@ on Fre@@ em@@ an said that G@@ ile@@ ad was entitled to relief from the fees it incurred while defending the case .
Mer@@ ck is trying to catch up to G@@ ile@@ ad , which dominates the market on a new generation of he@@ pati@@ tis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease .
The case dates back to 2013 when G@@ ile@@ ad and Mer@@ ck su@@ ed each other , claiming ownership of laboratory work underlying so@@ fo@@ s@@ bu@@ vi@@ r , the active ingredi@@ ent in G@@ ile@@ ad &apos;s drugs .
U@@ .@@ S. backed forces say they have seized full control of Man@@ bi@@ j from Islamic State
U@@ .@@ S@@ .@@ -@@ backed forces have seized full control of northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State fighters inside the city left , a spokes@@ man for the group said on Fri@@ day .
Syria Democratic Forces ( SD@@ F ) were now sweeping the city after the departure of a remaining group of militants who had been hol@@ ed up in the city .
They had fre@@ ed over 2,000 civilian ho@@ stages who had been held by the militants , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the SD@@ F allied Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council told Re@@ u@@ ters .
&quot; The city is now fully under our control but we are undertaking sweeping operations , &quot; he told Re@@ u@@ ters .
Clin@@ tons earned $ 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 , paid 3@@ 4.@@ 2 percent federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton on Fri@@ day released her 2015 tax returns , which showed the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $ 10.@@ 75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.@@ 2 percent .
In 2015 , the Clin@@ tons made $ 1 million in char@@ itable contributions , mostly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton brought in nearly $ 5.@@ 3 million in speaking fees ; and the former secretary of state reported income of $ 3 million from publi@@ sher Sim@@ on &amp; Sch@@ u@@ ster for her book on her tenure at the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s running m@@ ate , U@@ .@@ S. Senator T@@ im K@@ aine of Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , along with his wife , An@@ ne Hol@@ ton , released 10 years of tax returns .
They paid a federal effective tax rate of 20@@ .@@ 3 percent in 2015 .
&quot; Hillary Clinton and T@@ im K@@ aine continue to set the standard for financial transparency , &quot; Clinton campaign ai@@ de J@@ en@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri said in a statement .
In stark contrast , Donald Trump is hiding behind fake exc@@ uses and back@@ tracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns .
It is custom@@ ary for U@@ .@@ S. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public , although they are not required by law to do so .
Trump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have cited an audi@@ t by the Inter@@ nal Rev@@ en@@ ue Service as a reason for his refusal to release his returns .
&quot; Y@@ our move , &quot; Clinton campaign ai@@ de I@@ an S@@ ams said on Twitter , linking to the Democratic nominee &apos;s returns .
On Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day , Trump &apos;s special coun@@ sel , Michael Co@@ h@@ en , told CN@@ N he would not allow Trump to release them until the aud@@ its are complete .
Trump &apos;s critics , including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans , have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth , his char@@ itable contributions , his business deal@@ ings and various other ties , including with Russia .
Clinton has p@@ ounced on the issue , rele@@ asing an online video on Fri@@ day highlighting high-@@ profile Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes .
On Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day , she raised the issue during an economic speech in Mic@@ h@@ ig@@ an .
&quot; He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns , &quot; she told the crowd .
Poli@@ tic@@ o has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s , and a New York Times business colum@@ n@@ ist on Fri@@ day qu@@ oted a number of tax lawyers and accoun@@ tants saying that could still be the case .
Federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election .
Clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Bu@@ ffe@@ tt that would ensure those making more than $ 1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent .
President Barack Obama also backs the proposal .
At a Clinton rally last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Ne@@ bra@@ s@@ ka , Bu@@ ffe@@ tt , whose Ber@@ k@@ sh@@ ire H@@ ath@@ away con@@ gl@@ omer@@ ate is based there , challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns .
Bu@@ ff@@ et said that he too was under IR@@ S audi@@ t and Trump is &quot; afraid &quot; not of the tax-@@ collection agency but of voters .
Clinton &apos;s campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007 .
The Clin@@ tons , who now live in C@@ hap@@ pa@@ qu@@ a , New York , paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40@@ .5 percent .
The Clin@@ tons &apos; 2015 return showed that , unlike most Americans , just $ 100 of their income came from wages .
Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund , and the Clin@@ tons reported dividend and interest income of $ 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

Jewish fil@@ m@@ maker s@@ lam@@ s Berlin hotel for removing Israel di@@ al code after Arab &quot; request &quot; - R@@ T News
A French fil@@ m@@ maker of Jewish origin unleashed a media f@@ uro@@ r after he revealed that the K@@ emp@@ in@@ ski Bri@@ sto@@ l hotel in Berlin does not list Israel &apos;s di@@ al code , with employee citing &quot; requests &quot; from Ara@@ bic customers .
Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , an author of Holocaust docum@@ entary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; v@@ ented his frustration at the K@@ emp@@ in@@ ski Bri@@ sto@@ l Ho@@ tel in Berlin , writing an open letter in the German out@@ let FA@@ Z .
During his recent stay , Lan@@ z@@ mann tried to find Israel in the list of di@@ al codes provided by the hotel .
The country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room .
How is it possible , in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and eradic@@ ated ?
Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote .
Instead , K@@ emp@@ in@@ ski Bri@@ sto@@ l offers an opportunity to di@@ al Israel via an own call center .
Se@@ e@@ king explanation , the fil@@ m@@ maker addressed the issue at the hotel &apos;s rec@@ eption .
The answer he got there , Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote &quot; shocked him . &quot;
The hotel &apos;s cler@@ k said that the measure was &quot; a deliberate decision by the management of K@@ emp@@ in@@ sk@@ i-@@ H@@ ot@@ els . &quot;
The reason behind the move triggered even more outrage by the fil@@ m@@ maker .
&quot; The majority of our gu@@ ests are Arabs and they demanded Israel &apos;s code to be de@@ le@@ ted , &quot; the employee was qu@@ oted as saying by Lan@@ z@@ mann .
Israeli ambassador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov H@@ ad@@ as-@@ Han@@ del@@ s@@ man called the case a &quot; great shame , &quot; Sud@@ de@@ ut@@ sche Ze@@ it@@ ung reports .
We were app@@ alled and shocked by the incident .
It is in itself a great shame .
The fact that it has occurred in Germany and at that very hotel chain , is an even greater disg@@ race .
That needs no explanation .
We expect that the hotel draws the right conclusions , &quot; the official said .
The incident triggered quite a response online , with people calling it a scandal .
Some alleged that the K@@ emp@@ in@@ ski hotel simply &quot; ca@@ ved in &quot; to the alleged demands of Ara@@ bic customers .
&quot; Sha@@ me on you , &quot; another post stated , pointing out that the hotel , located in the no@@ ble Kur@@ fur@@ st@@ end@@ am@@ m street stands near a syn@@ ago@@ gue .
The hotel itself was quick to br@@ ush off any accusations , calling what happened an &quot; oversight &quot; and &quot; apologi@@ zing &quot; to Lan@@ z@@ mann , D@@ er Sp@@ ie@@ gel reports .
&quot; There was never a direct order &quot; not to include Israel in the fast di@@ al list , &quot; Sud@@ de@@ ut@@ sche Ze@@ it@@ ung qu@@ oted a K@@ emp@@ in@@ ski representative as saying .
It adds that the code was now added .
Poli@@ ce use te@@ ar gas &amp; rub@@ ber bul@@ lets against prote@@ sting Brazilian students
Stu@@ d@@ ents clash@@ ed with police in the Brazilian city of Sa@@ o Paul@@ o on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms to the public education system .
Poli@@ ce used te@@ ar gas and rub@@ ber bul@@ lets against the protesters .
The trouble started when law enforcement officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to the police using rub@@ ber bul@@ lets and te@@ ar gas .
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their dis@@ may at the plans .
Under proposals from the governor of the state of Sa@@ o Paul@@ o Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ m@@ in , just under 100 public schools will be closed , while 300,000 students will be re@@ located in order to save money .
Some of those taking part in the protest could be seen writing gra@@ ff@@ iti on the walls against the interim President Michel T@@ em@@ er .
This latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en mas@@ se to support suspended President Dil@@ ma Rousseff as the country &apos;s sen@@ ate voted for her impe@@ achment .
S@@ co@@ t Cal@@ lum S@@ kin@@ ner storms home as Br@@ its grab cyc@@ ling gold
Scotland &apos;s Cal@@ lum S@@ kin@@ ner rac@@ ed to gl@@ ory in the men &apos;s team sp@@ rint at the Rio velo@@ drome last night as the Te@@ am GB tri@@ o defended the title from London 2012 .
The Glas@@ we@@ gian 23@@ -year-old was in the anchor role that his fellow Scot@@ s@@ man S@@ ir Ch@@ ris Ho@@ y made his own and the youn@@ g@@ ster did the leg@@ end proud as he stor@@ med home to s@@ nat@@ ch victory from the fav@@ ou@@ red New Zealand out@@ fit .
Britain claimed a shock victory four years ago to win as Ho@@ y claimed the fifth of his six Olympic gol@@ ds .
And they repeated the trick after fin@@ ishing a low@@ ly sixth at March &apos;s T@@ rac@@ k World Cha@@ mp@@ ion@@ ships in London , despite Ho@@ y having since retired .
The issue between Beijing and London was replacing speci@@ alist star@@ ter Jam@@ ie Sta@@ ff .
They did so just in time as H@@ in@@ des emerged .
Ho@@ y &apos;s retirement also created a vo@@ id which K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Mat@@ t C@@ ramp@@ ton tried to fill .
S@@ kin@@ ner was the man Britain &apos;s co@@ aches stuck with , seeing potential in the S@@ co@@ t which has now been reali@@ sed .
H@@ in@@ des , Ken@@ ny - champions with Ho@@ y four years ago - and S@@ kin@@ ner set an Olympic record in quali@@ fying , but the standard was over@@ taken by New Zealand in the first round .
And the British tri@@ o won the du@@ el for gold .
H@@ in@@ des was narrowly behind after his la@@ p , but Ken@@ ny pushed the team in front and S@@ kin@@ ner held on .
A change of strategy was a big part of the transformation , with H@@ in@@ des riding a bigger ge@@ ar to slow him down and allow Ken@@ ny and , in particular , S@@ kin@@ ner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y watched on from his position as a B@@ BC pun@@ di@@ t and caught the eye of S@@ kin@@ ner , Ken@@ ny and H@@ in@@ des when they stepped on to the po@@ di@@ um .
The 23@@ -year-old S@@ kin@@ ner , from Glas@@ go@@ w , said : &quot; It &apos;s a fl@@ at@@ tering comparison . &quot;
I &apos;@@ m just out there to do my best and make a name for myself .
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions .
It was just incre@@ di@@ ble .
There &apos;s no better way to win it .
After trium@@ ph@@ ing at London 2012 alongside Ken@@ ny and Ho@@ y , H@@ in@@ des admitted to deliberately falling to the track following a poor start .
He later re@@ tracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from Britain &apos;s rivals .
There was no such issue this time around in a supreme victory .
H@@ in@@ des said : &quot; It felt like London , with all the GB flag@@ s in the stand . &quot;
We all as a team came together in the last three months .
We &apos;@@ ve been losing out on so many world ti@@ t@@ les , so to win the Olympics again is just amaz@@ ing .
That is one event , one gold me@@ dal for the nation which won seven out of 10 track ti@@ t@@ les in both Beijing and London .
If that is a bar@@ ome@@ ter of the progress made in the last five months , then a successful five days in the velo@@ drome awa@@ its .
With the form Ken@@ ny demonstrated , it is not beyond the real@@ ms of possibility to imagine him repeating Ho@@ y &apos;s feat of winning three Olympic gol@@ ds in one Games .
That would see Ken@@ ny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who is also born on 23 March ( that seemingly sacred date in British sport which is also the birth@@ day of Ste@@ ve Re@@ d@@ grave , M@@ o Far@@ ah and Ro@@ ger B@@ ann@@ ister ) - take his tally to six gold me@@ d@@ als and one silver .
That would be the same as Ho@@ y &apos;s .
Ken@@ ny next compe@@ tes in the sp@@ rint , which begins on today and plays out over three days .
The 28@@ -year-old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I &apos;@@ m just enjoying this one for now .
The team event is always the best .
You get to win it with your m@@ ates .
It &apos;s a bit l@@ one@@ ly winning on your own to be honest .
H@@ in@@ des said : &quot; If he wins another two gold me@@ d@@ als , he should get a k@@ n@@ igh@@ tho@@ od . &quot;
It was the day &apos;s only me@@ dal event , but there was further good news for Britain .
S@@ ir Bra@@ d@@ ley W@@ ig@@ g@@ ins , E@@ d C@@ lan@@ cy , St@@ even Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified fastest in the four-@@ man , four-@@ kilome@@ t@@ res team pursuit .
They finished in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 43 .
The world record , set in winning gold at London 2012 , is 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 65@@ 9 .
The first round and final ( 10.@@ 4@@ 2@@ p@@ m ) take place on today &apos;s second day of action , where W@@ ig@@ g@@ ins is sure to be the focus .
He had a dispute with commis@@ sa@@ i@@ res yester@@ day ahead of the quali@@ fication ride , when officials sum@@ mon@@ ed him to measure his height .
In the corresponding women &apos;s event , which resum@@ es and concludes tomorrow , La@@ ura Tro@@ tt , Jo@@ ann@@ a R@@ ow@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ ati@@ e Ar@@ chi@@ bal@@ d of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e advanced in a world record time , clo@@ c@@ king 4 : 13@@ .@@ 2@@ 60 .
Te@@ am GB have come to rely on its migh@@ ty track cyc@@ ling squ@@ ad to take ownership of the middle period of an Olympic Games and deliver a host of me@@ d@@ als .
After truly exceptional show@@ ings of ut@@ ter dominance at Beijing and London , expectations have been played down in the lead@@ -up to Rio .
There have been dram@@ as in the background , not least the resignation of technical director S@@ han@@ e Su@@ tton in April amid sex@@ ism and bul@@ lying allegations , and the reti@@ rements of giant figures like Ho@@ y and Vic@@ t@@ oria P@@ end@@ le@@ ton .
However , on the evidence of the first night &apos;s rac@@ ing in the velo@@ drome , it looks like GB &apos;s now le@@ gen@@ dary reputation for pe@@ aking at the perfect time could be about to be repeated once again .
After the little baby came to this world , Mo@@ m and D@@ ad shall be responsible for his life , not only for his health , but also for the development of his spirit , that is , education .
If such education failed , then no matter how successful your career is , you cannot make up for the shortcomings of life and family failure .
When a new baby is born , the new d@@ ad and mo@@ m need to spend time in taking care of and educ@@ ating him , and be responsible for him .
And responsibility is not only reflected in the care of body , making them healthy , but also the education of spirit . That is , to make children learn how to behave , grow up and succeed .
Good family education means that parents often need to ac@@ company their children , to take care of them pati@@ ently and teach them develop a civilized behavior and make them learn knowledge better and enhance intelligence .
Pa@@ rents &apos; words and deeds will affect the growth of their children because they will imit@@ ate their parents . And that is the so called , &quot; like father , like son &quot; . Y@@ our son will be the same as you .
So we need to be a good example in front of children , regulate our words , cultiv@@ ate our charac@@ ters , which will indirectly help children shape their own excellent character , so that he will become more excellent .
A@@ my is a smart and pretty gir@@ l .

But A@@ my has a little secret in her heart : she cannot concentrate long on what she wants to do and works on .
This secret is accompanied by A@@ my for a long time . U@@ su@@ ally the problem is not serious .
Even though she lear@@ ns and works in decentralized , mo@@ d@@ ular , she can complete the task basically , and achieve good results .
However , when the task is heavy and pressing , A@@ my feels very painful and tortured .
The individual &apos;s resistance to self-@@ exposure and his emotional experience is to prevent the individual &apos;s self-@@ awareness and self-@@ e@@ ste@@ em from threatening .
And some behavi@@ orist psycho@@ logists understand the impe@@ dance as an individual &apos;s di@@ so@@ be@@ di@@ ence to their behavioral correc@@ tions .
I tried to let A@@ my do an exercise , let her brea@@ the through the way to calm down and feel the tor@@ ment .
And once he left the trapped situation , she felt rela@@ xed and regain@@ ed freedom .

4 years after Uber joined the Taiwan market , it caused no small impact on the local traditional tax@@ i industry .
According to the information of Taiwan &quot; United D@@ aily News &quot; on August 12 , more than 100 tax@@ ies byp@@ as@@ sed Taiwan Executive Y@@ uan for protest . This resulted in serious traffic paralysis in the surrounding area .
It has been four years since the arrival of Uber in Taiwan , but the authority just launched the meeting at the end of this month . D@@ rivers cannot wait any more , said Z@@ hen@@ g Li@@ j@@ ia , the chairman of Tai@@ pe@@ i D@@ river Union .

After the verdict comes into effect , because Lee did not automatically fulfill the obligation to determine the verdict , W@@ ang apply for enforcement to the S@@ hu@@ yang court .
On October 16 , 2014 , S@@ hu@@ yang court made a civil ruling , and ruled that all of the 2,000 farm laying h@@ ens shall only be seized and shall not be transferred and sold without per@@ mission .
After Lee received the detention ruling , without the per@@ mission of the S@@ hu@@ yang court , he privately sold partial eg@@ g laying h@@ ens .

The head of the Department of Industrial Co@@ ordin@@ ation of the National Development and Reform Commission said that iron and steel overcapacity is now a global problem .
China &apos;s capacity utili@@ zation in recent years is higher than the global average , but also higher than that of the United States and Europe and other countries and regions .
China has taken resolu@@ te and effective measures to resolve excess capacity , and the results are gradually emerging .
The official pointed out that the CP@@ C Central Committee and State Council should att@@ ach great importance to the global problem of iron and steel overcapacity .
All departments and regions should actively implement the deployment of the State Council , ear@@ ne@@ stly carry out the work , and reduce crude steel production capacity by 45 million tons this year .
From China &apos;s national conditions , China does not encourage steel exports . On the contrary , it also takes a series of practical measures to control steel exports .
The person in charge stressed that the international trade of iron and steel products is essentially a market behavior and an independent choice from the requirement of importing countries and after considering the product cost and other factors .
The implementation of trade protection measures does not help to fundamentally solve the global steel industry development issues . On the contrary , it will only cause further impact on the international trade order .
When it comes to debt , the person in charge stressed that the resolution of the debt problem is to properly handle the important issues that need proper handling .
As the iron and steel enterprises are large-scale and involve a wide range of enterprises , the debt relationship is complex . It may lead to regional risks if dis@@ posed of impro@@ per@@ ly .
According to the person in charge , in recent years , with the economic downward pressure to increase , the total social demand gradually weakened , part of the industry capacity utili@@ zation decreased and enterprise production and management difficulties increased .
Some enterprises do not meet the changes in the market environment and the production and management is difficult to sustain or even on the brink of collapse . But restra@@ ined by some institutional factors , they become &quot; zombie enterprises &quot; due to many obstacles to the market .
The existence of these companies distorted market signal , reduced the elements resources use efficiency , increased the cost of social management , thereby hin@@ dering the establishment of market environment with fair competition .
The main reason for the loss is the same as the dilemma faced by the global steel industry - weak market demand and low utili@@ zation rate .
China mainly adop@@ ts the market mechanism , economic means and the rule of law . The government is mainly to do the work of dis@@ closing the ins and outs to workers and social stability , to ensure fair and equitable market order .
The person in charge stressed that the next step is to do a good job to ensure overcapacity cutting and ensuring the objective of resolving 100 million ton@@ s-@@ 150 million tons of crude steel production capacity within five years .
In the after@@ no@@ on of the 10@@ th day of the month , the appearance of Chinese tou@@ rist police in the Red Square in Moscow immediately drew people &apos;s attention . Chinese tourists wa@@ ved with surprise , and the local people and foreign tourists cannot help but to stop looking back .
On the same day , China &apos;s first professional travel police team - members of T@@ ou@@ rism Poli@@ ce De@@ t@@ achment , S@@ anya City , H@@ ain@@ an Prov@@ ince Public Security Bu@@ reau came to the Red Square in Moscow , and communic@@ ated with the local police on duty .
Moscow travel police are divided into three groups for duty pat@@ ro@@ l in the Red Square , Nic@@ oli@@ es@@ ki pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an street and G@@ u M@@ u Department St@@ ore . The Chinese tou@@ rist police also followed for study . The whole process lasted more than an hour .
F@@ em@@ ale police officer Liu X@@ ini@@ e is 20-@@ plus years old , pro@@ fic@@ i@@ ent in English and Spanish . She just joined the tourism police team last year .
He carefully observed every word and action of the Russian counterparts and communic@@ ated with her from time to time .
When he saw Spanish tourists come for consultation , the Moscow travel police explained to him with flu@@ ent Spanish , which im@@ pressed W@@ ang B@@ ing .
&quot; Every Moscow travel poli@@ cem@@ an master foreign language , and some even can speak more than two languages , which im@@ pressed us a lot . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ain@@ an , as an international tou@@ rist island , is gradually paying attention to attract international tourists . We hope to improve their ability to match the status of international tourism island . &quot;
On the current day before the study , the Chinese tou@@ rist police also went to the bri@@ gade station of Moscow city police to communicate with their Russian counterparts .
&quot; I often deal with Chinese tourists and I am very happen to see them travel to Russia . &quot;
&quot; Their usual questions are : where is x@@ x@@ x , for example , where is a mon@@ ument , how to rent a tax@@ i and how to return to the hotel . &quot;
Le@@ i S@@ ak@@ ov , the bri@@ gade cap@@ tain of Moscow city police said that in recent years , Moscow &apos;s urban environment and tourism ambi@@ ence have become better and better , attracting more and more foreign tourists .
In order to meet the needs of tourism development , it set up a tou@@ rist police team in July 2014 , responsible for pat@@ ro@@ l in the major scen@@ ic spots , thus helping and diver@@ ting the tourists .
At present , all Moscow tou@@ rist poli@@ c@@ emen are pro@@ fic@@ i@@ ent in English and some also master Spanish and German .
The police bri@@ gade divided them into nine groups according to their foreign language levels . They have two classes per week , learn self-defense moves , laws and regulations and foreign languages .
&quot; At present , there are two tou@@ rist police beginning to learn Chinese and they can speak flu@@ ently . We have to continue to improve their Chinese level , &quot; L@@ y@@ s@@ ak@@ ov said .
L@@ y@@ s@@ ak@@ ov told reporters that the Moscow T@@ ou@@ rism Poli@@ ce since its inc@@ eption , have accumulated a certain amount of experience and hoped to inspire counterparts in S@@ anya .
He believes that the cooperation between the Russian and Chinese police departments will enhance the security sense of their citizens to each other &apos;s national tourism .
&quot; The recru@@ iting , police mode and equipment of Moscow tour police officers and their excellent interactions with visit@@ ors have brought us a lot of inspiration . &quot; Chen Xia@@ ok@@ un said .
Chin@@ an@@ e@@ ws journalist found that there are at least nine provinces and cities issuing rules for the implementation of resid@@ ence permit , including He@@ be@@ i , J@@ ili@@ n , Ti@@ anj@@ in , Ji@@ ang@@ x@@ i , S@@ ic@@ hu@@ an , H@@ ain@@ an , G@@ an@@ s@@ u , Fu@@ j@@ ian and Beijing , etc .
For the conditions of applying for resid@@ ence permit , the above regions generally said that the appli@@ can@@ ts need to live more than six months and meet one of these three requirements : having legitimate and stable employment , having legal and stable resid@@ ence and continuous study .
Chin@@ an@@ e@@ ws journalist noted that in the aspect of resid@@ ence permit providing treatment , the &quot; gold content &quot; is different in various cities . Compared with the national provisions , some areas have provided more public services and conveni@@ ences .
These areas have increased the conveni@@ ences of children to attend college ent@@ rance examination in the local place while meeting the related requirement .
In addition , it is clearly proposed by Beijing and other places that they will gradually expand the scope of public services and convenience , and regularly release to the community .
For example , Fu@@ j@@ ian proposed to announce the public services and convenience of resid@@ ence permit holders to the public at least every 3 years
&quot; Re@@ sid@@ ence Per@@ mit Provi@@ sional Regul@@ ations &quot; provides that , for those in line with the resid@@ ence permit conditions , the public security organs shall issue a resid@@ ence permit within 15 days from the date of acceptance .
For the time limit , most of the region hold the same opinion with the national version . That is , to release the permit within 15 days .
He@@ be@@ i clearly stipul@@ ates that for appli@@ can@@ ts who meet the conditions of application and have complete application documents , the resid@@ ence police station shall issue a resid@@ ence permit within 3 working days from the date of acceptance .
Ji@@ ang@@ x@@ i clearly stipul@@ ates that for appli@@ can@@ ts who meet the conditions of application and have complete application documents , the public security shall issue a resid@@ ence permit within 5 working days from the date of acceptance .
In accordance with the &quot; resid@@ ence permit provi@@ sional regulations &quot; , the above cities stipul@@ ate clearly that the cost of cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate production shall be exemp@@ ted in case of initial application of resid@@ ence permit .
For example , S@@ ic@@ hu@@ an required the local police stations or commis@@ sioned community service agencies shall strictly enforce the approved fees and charges standard and resolu@@ tely prohi@@ bit over-@@ range , over-@@ standard fees or ride fees .
It was found that on July 27 , 2016 , Chen Y@@ ang@@ x@@ ia , the former G@@ an@@ zhou City D@@ ing@@ nan Coun@@ ty Party Secretary came to the Prov@@ in@@ cial Commission for Dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine In@@ spec@@ tion for reporting and serving as director of the CP@@ C supervision room ( deputy direc@@ tor-@@ general , one year &apos;s prob@@ ation period ) .
The red w@@ ine at the din@@ ner was provided by Li You@@ ca@@ i while other costs were borne by Liu .
Ji@@ ang@@ x@@ i Prov@@ in@@ cial Commission for Dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine In@@ spec@@ tion informed that Chen Y@@ ang@@ x@@ ia and Chen@@ g Z@@ ili@@ ang , who organized and accepted din@@ ing inv@@ itation in private clubs , violated the spirit of the central eight provisions and the Party &apos;s discipline .
Last season , Po@@ g@@ ba was punished with two yel@@ low cards . He will be banned automatically according to the rules .
Although he has transferred back to the Premi@@ ership , the Foot@@ ball Association Challenge Cup ( F@@ A Cup ) still passes his accumul@@ ative susp@@ ension to F@@ A Cup .
In this way , on August 14 , in the away games of fighting against B@@ our@@ n@@ em@@ outh , Po@@ g@@ ba will watch a fight without helping any party . His first show after return to Manch@@ ester United will be extended to Sou@@ th@@ amp@@ ton &apos;s home game on August 20 .
As the No@@ .@@ 12 new arrival of the first round in 2014 , S@@ ali@@ c will officially land on the N@@ BA in the next season , and join the Ph@@ il@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a 7@@ 6@@ ers .
As a young European player , S@@ ali@@ c is not known to many fans . But I believe he im@@ pressed people with his performance in this Olympic Games .
In a game with win by a narrow margin of Cro@@ atian over Spain , S@@ ali@@ c@@ i successfully blocked Paul - G@@ as@@ ol in his last moment and tried to drag the game into the over@@ time basket attack .
Recently , Bre@@ tt@@ -@@ Brown , the comman@@ der-@@ in-@@ chief of the 7@@ 6-@@ team gave S@@ ali@@ c a high rating . He thought he saw the shadow of young Manu@@ -@@ G@@ in@@ ob@@ il@@ i in Sar@@ ic .
It is quite obvious that Sar@@ ic already showed his gift and made 76 people full of expectations .
In Croatia &apos;s first two games of the Olympic Games , S@@ ali@@ c received a total of 24 points , 17 reb@@ ounds and 12 as@@ sists .
In the first half , S@@ ali@@ c showed his capability of drawing space on the scene . He can have a shot outside the three-@@ point line via the pick and roll with his colleagues .
Although the current 7@@ 6-@@ team is pac@@ ked with many gi@@ fted young players , they are not equipped with the outside scor@@ ing capability as S@@ ali@@ c .
From block shot to launching a long pass , fast break and complete as@@ sists , there are just a few in@@ siders who can do it on the N@@ BA game .
Since the beginning of this Olympic Games , S@@ ali@@ c has obtained 13 points , eight back@@ boards and five as@@ sists in three games , with a full performance .
James has signed two 1 + 1 contracts since he decided to return to the C@@ av@@ ali@@ ers in the summer of 2014 .
Now , as this labor agreement is about to enter the last year , James will be in the forefront of labor negotiations as the vice chairman of N@@ BA player union .
The substantial increase in union revenue is attributed to the new television protocol . The question is how the bo@@ ss and players deal with the money . The outside world is worried that the N@@ BA will fall in the next summer .
But for James , he will not have to worry that he will become a free agent next summer because he has renewed a 3@@ -year contract with the C@@ av@@ ali@@ ers .
No matter when the 201@@ 7-@@ 18 season k@@ ic@@ ks off , James is within the contract .
Since the stunning de@@ but of iPh@@ one@@ S@@ E , the mobile phone market also u@@ she@@ red in a small scre@@ en machine boom .
Not long ago , Nu@@ bia also launched the first works of its Z@@ 11 series : nu@@ bi@@ a@@ Z@@ 11@@ min@@ i .
Nu@@ bi@@ a@@ Z@@ 11@@ min@@ i follows its consistent photo@@ graph@@ ed gene , and is equipped with a one-@@ hand easi@@ er-@@ to-@@ hold 5.@@ 0-@@ in@@ ch scre@@ en , port@@ able and convenient post-@@ fing@@ er@@ print recognition , contributing to its superior experience .
A small scre@@ en cam@@ era phone Z@@ 11@@ min@@ i , which was just listed by Nu@@ bia , had a price fall of RMB 200 , decreas@@ ing from the original RMB 14@@ 99 to RMB 12@@ 99 .
In appearance , nu@@ bi@@ a@@ Z@@ 11@@ min@@ i uses a 5-@@ in@@ ch 10@@ 80@@ P scre@@ en . The classic &quot; little red circle &quot; design is below on the front side .
The middle frame is me@@ tal material . Its bottom adop@@ ts sym@@ metri@@ cal design and is equipped with Ty@@ pe@@ -@@ C data inter@@ face .
Por@@ t@@ land sm@@ el@@ ter &apos;s future in doubt with ax@@ ing of power contract
The future of the Por@@ t@@ land alu@@ mini@@ um sm@@ el@@ ter in Vic@@ t@@ oria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant dis@@ closing one of the plant &apos;s owners is to termin@@ ate a supply contract , with all supply contracts expected to be a@@ xed .
The move follows the decision of the Vic@@ t@@ oria government earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the plant in operation .
A 20@@ -year fixed subsidy exp@@ i@@ res in November .
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Al@@ co@@ a &apos;s Por@@ t@@ land plant .
As many as 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk with any closure .
And there could be additional knoc@@ k-@@ on effects since the sm@@ el@@ ter consum@@ es around 10 per cent of Vic@@ t@@ oria &apos;s entire electricity output .
In 2014 , Al@@ co@@ a closed the Po@@ int Henry sm@@ el@@ ter which led to the closure last year of the Ang@@ le@@ sea power plant .
Al@@ co@@ a &apos;s Por@@ t@@ land sm@@ el@@ ter is losing money and risks closure .
The moves follows speculation about the future of the plant for several years now , initially in the wake of the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plant .
A@@ G@@ L , which supplies the big alu@@ mini@@ um sm@@ el@@ ter with electricity from its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in the L@@ atro@@ be Valley , said it expects the other three owners will also move to termin@@ ate their agreements .
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Al@@ co@@ a and A@@ lu@@ min@@ a , with China &apos;s CI@@ T@@ I@@ C and Japan &apos;s Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p holding smaller shares .
&quot; A@@ G@@ L expects the Por@@ t@@ land facility to continue to operate , meaning physical demand for electricity from the sm@@ el@@ ter will continue , &quot; it said .
A@@ G@@ L said the contracts are so-called &apos; hed@@ ging contracts &apos; which were due to take effect from November 2016 .
The contracts have a 12@@ -@@ month termin@@ ation period so they will actually finish in 2017 .
&quot; As such , A@@ G@@ L continues to expect the contracts to contribute to earnings in fiscal year 17 , &quot; the power company said .
Any potential earnings impact on A@@ G@@ L from F@@ Y@@ 18 on@@ wards is currently limited by the strong futures market outlook for wholesale electricity prices .
A@@ G@@ L said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its accounts by $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a termin@@ ation event . &quot;
Al@@ co@@ a said the decision to close out the contracts &quot; does not affect Al@@ co@@ a &apos;s ... ability to operate the sm@@ el@@ ter or secure electricity supply to the sm@@ el@@ ter . &quot;
The US company said it entered into a 20@@ -year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang in 2010 , which was due to comm@@ ence from November this year , although it has yet to explain why it has pulled out of the contract .
Analy@@ sts have been wary of the possible closure of both of the Por@@ t@@ land sm@@ el@@ ter in Vic@@ t@@ oria and also the T@@ om@@ ago plant near New@@ cast@@ le due to the poor economics of the industry .
Ad@@ dressing analysts earlier in the week , A@@ G@@ L &apos;s head of operations , Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said Por@@ t@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ awat@@ ts of power annually and T@@ om@@ ago around 900 meg@@ awat@@ ts .
If both of those plants go from the market that &apos;s a significant reduction in demand in the &#91; electricity &#93; market .
And as a gener@@ ator that wouldn &apos;t be good for us , &quot; he said .
Community legal cent@@ res turn away 160@@ ,000 people a year
More than 160@@ ,000 of the nation &apos;s most vulnerable are turned away from community legal cent@@ res every year , with the sector brac@@ ing itself for the impact further funding cuts will have on already-@@ stretched operations .
In Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly the elderly , immigrants , vulnerable workers , victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair ev@@ ic@@ tions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation .
Community legal services , already stretched beyond limits , are brac@@ ing for further cuts .
From June next year , those legal cent@@ res are sl@@ ated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding .
Director of Community Le@@ gal Cent@@ res Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said the latest National Association of Community Le@@ gal Cent@@ res C@@ en@@ sus Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year .
M@@ r Far@@ rel@@ l said without a reversal of the federal government decision , the situation was only going to get worse .
&quot; Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community legal cent@@ res are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , meaning thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need , &quot; he said .
People leaving violent relationships , people with un@@ manageable and crip@@ pling debts , families going through separation , workers who are un@@ fairly sac@@ ked - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions , and this report shows that they &apos;@@ re not able to get the help they need .
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017 , which means thousands more vulnerable Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ land@@ ers will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help .
We call on the Att@@ or@@ ne@@ y-@@ General , and Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ land Senator George B@@ ran@@ dis to immediately reverse these funding cuts , so people can get the help they need when they &apos;@@ re faced with a legal problem .
Last year , the state government delivered on its commitment to bring legal aid funding up to the national average .
It &apos;s now time to look at the needs of community legal cent@@ res and their cli@@ ent communities , and for the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government to invest in this important work .
Donald Trump campaign su@@ ed after staff@@ er allegedly pulled a gun
New York : Donald Trump &apos;s campaign was su@@ ed for allegedly doing nothing after being told that the director of its North Car@@ ol@@ ina operations pulled a gun on a staff@@ er as they drove in a Je@@ ep in February .
The incident was described in a law@@ suit fil@@ ed on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day in state court in Char@@ lo@@ t@@ te by V@@ inc@@ ent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software tra@@ in@@ er for the state campaign .
B@@ ordin@@ i said he wa@@ ited for months for the situation to be handled internally before reali@@ sing &quot; this was not going to happen . &quot;
The director , Ear@@ l Ph@@ illi@@ p , &quot; produced a p@@ ist@@ ol , put his right index f@@ inger on the trigger , and drove the barrel into V@@ inc@@ ent &apos;s k@@ ne@@ e cap , &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i said in the compla@@ int .
After compla@@ ining to local and regional campaign leadership , B@@ ordin@@ i learned that at least four other people had experience the same thing with Ph@@ illi@@ p , according to the fil@@ ing .
&quot; G@@ un@@ s don &apos;t have to fire to inflic@@ t damage , &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i said in the compla@@ int .
The suit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused a fur@@ ore when telling a crowd in North Car@@ ol@@ ina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment people &quot; -@@ - understood to be gun owners and gun enthusi@@ asts -@@ - could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and gets her pick of judges .
Trump &apos;s campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he wasn &apos;t advocating violence .
B@@ ordin@@ i &apos;s compla@@ int seeks compensation from the campaign for negli@@ gent supervision , and from Ph@@ illi@@ p for assault , bat@@ tery and inflic@@ tion of emotional distress .
Trump spokes@@ woman Hope H@@ ic@@ ks didn &apos;t immediately return a message seeking comment .
Att@@ emp@@ ts to reach Ph@@ illi@@ p were un@@ successful .
W@@ CC@@ B , a local news affili@@ ate in Char@@ lo@@ t@@ te , reported Ph@@ illi@@ p recently left the campaign .
A call left at his consul@@ ting firm , Inno@@ v@@ ative Con@@ sul@@ ting Services , wasn &apos;t immediately returned .

Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will also deliver reg@@ ener@@ ation and prosperity not just in our local communities and across London , but across the country .
For me , this was the great attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as it was with London 2012 , where we made enormous efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games .
The Olympics achieved huge benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
And , we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and firms close to He@@ ath@@ row .
For our local communities alone we &apos;@@ ll create 10,000 new app@@ ren@@ tic@@ e@@ ships , 40@@ ,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the air@@ port .
Just as there were ahead of London 2012 , there will be those that think the challenge of He@@ ath@@ row expansion is too great .
I was told that Britain would be never be ready for the Games and that we would be embarra@@ ssed on the world stage .
The doub@@ ters were wrong on 2012 and they will be proved wrong on He@@ ath@@ row .
There are always obstacles to be overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row is answ@@ ering every question asked of it .
Like the Olympics , He@@ ath@@ row is an infrastructure project for the many , not just the few .
Ex@@ pan@@ sion is an opportunity to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11@@ b@@ n in economic growth , leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the air@@ port and across the UK .
We have a great team at He@@ ath@@ row who have implemented an £ 11@@ b@@ n program@@ me of infrastructure investment on time and on budget , from T@@ 5 - voted the world &apos;s best air@@ port termin@@ al five years in a row , to T@@ 2 , built in the middle of the world &apos;s bu@@ si@@ est two run@@ ways .
Now they stand ready to deliver a third run@@ way , backed by £ 16 billion of private investment .
The London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row expansion will be too .
It is time for us to channel that Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row , securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of .

Wom@@ an run over on Swiss mo@@ tor@@ way in apparent suicide
The victim was lying on the mo@@ tor@@ way in the middle of the night .
Poli@@ ce are appealing for wit@@ nesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a mo@@ tor@@ way in the early hours of Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day in an apparent act of suicide .
The incident happened on the A@@ 1 near Mor@@ ges in the can@@ ton of V@@ au@@ d just after mid@@ night on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day .
A woman lay down in the dark on the road &quot; in a desperate act &quot; and was hit by several vehicles , V@@ au@@ d police said in a statement .
Clearly looking to kill herself , the victim , a Swiss woman aged 49 , was hit by several vehicles including a lor@@ ry .
She died at the scene .
Several of the drivers involved have already been inter@@ viewed but some are still un@@ identified , said police , who are calling for them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to come forward .
A criminal investigation has been opened , a &quot; logical &quot; step in a situation like this , lawyer G@@ ill@@ es H@@ of@@ ste@@ t@@ ter told Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
However it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges .
Was it possible to avoid impact ?
That &apos;s what the prosecutor must determine , &quot; said H@@ of@@ ste@@ t@@ ter .
Two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible .
In each case - both of which involved a person walking on the mo@@ tor@@ way in the dark - it was judged that mo@@ tor@@ ists cannot expect to come across a pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an on the mo@@ tor@@ way in the middle of the night , said the paper .
Last year a police officer was acqu@@ it@@ ted of causing death by negli@@ gence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the A@@ 1 near Pay@@ ner@@ ne one night in August 2014 .
The 2@@ 2-@@ year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road , the court heard .
The court found that the poli@@ ce@@ woman -@@ - who was responding to an emergency call -@@ - was driving in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely exceptional and unpredictable situation , &quot; the judge said .
Anyone with information about Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day &apos;s incident near Mor@@ ges should call police on 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 8@@ 3 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : V@@ en@@ us was once hab@@ itable
V@@ en@@ us was likely once hab@@ itable , according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
Scientists at NASA &apos;s Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Sp@@ ace Studies developed a model to explore V@@ en@@ us &apos; past using tools and algorith@@ ms similar to those employed by climate scientists .
The model was designed to determine whether or not V@@ en@@ us , with its hot , water-@@ less surface and CO@@ 2-@@ ch@@ oc@@ ked atmosphere , might have once hosted Ear@@ th-@@ like conditions .
Scientists have previously suggested that V@@ en@@ us &apos; slow ro@@ tation rate is explained by its th@@ ick atmosphere .
But the latest simul@@ ation suggests V@@ en@@ us could have bo@@ ast@@ ed a thin , Ear@@ th-@@ like atmosphere and still sp@@ un slowly .
The model also looked at the to@@ po@@ graphy of early V@@ en@@ us .
The planet likely feat@@ ured more dry regions than Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to host life and guard against rapid ev@@ ap@@ oration .
Early V@@ en@@ us also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent di@@ m@@ mer .
&quot; In the G@@ IS@@ S model &apos;s simul@@ ation , V@@ en@@ us &apos; slow spin ex@@ poses its day@@ side to the sun for almost two months at a time , &quot; G@@ IS@@ S scientist An@@ th@@ ony D@@ el Gen@@ i@@ o explained in a news release .
This war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a th@@ ick la@@ yer of clou@@ ds , which acts like an umb@@ rel@@ la to shi@@ eld the surface from much of the solar heating .
The result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees co@@ ol@@ er than Earth &apos;s today .
The model produced a story of V@@ en@@ us similar to the evolution previously hypo@@ the@@ sized by plan@@ etary scientists .
Though likely once hab@@ itable , V@@ en@@ us was -@@ - over the course of several billion years -@@ - exposed to too much heat and ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let light .
Its oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and its water v@@ ap@@ or was burned away by ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let light .
As its hydro@@ gen escaped , all that was left was a th@@ ick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a de@@ ath@@ ly greenhouse gas effect -@@ - thus , the V@@ en@@ us we know today .
Re@@ search@@ ers shared the results of their new V@@ en@@ us climate model in the journal Ge@@ op@@ hy@@ sical Research Le@@ t@@ ters .
Pat@@ ric@@ k Ro@@ y re@@ signs as A@@ val@@ anch@@ e co@@ ach
Pat@@ ric@@ k Ro@@ y resigned as co@@ ach and vice president of the ho@@ c@@ key operations of the Col@@ or@@ ado A@@ val@@ anch@@ e on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day , citing a lack of a voice within the team &apos;s decision-making process .
Col@@ or@@ ado executive vice president / general manag@@ er Jo@@ e S@@ ak@@ ic confirmed the move and noted that the club will begin a search for a new co@@ ach immediately .
&quot; For the past three years , I have carried out my duties as head co@@ ach and vice president of ho@@ c@@ key operations for the Col@@ or@@ ado A@@ val@@ anch@@ e with energy , passion and determination , &quot; the 50@@ -year-old Ro@@ y said in the statement .
I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level .
To achieve this , the vision of the co@@ ach and V@@ P@@ -@@ ho@@ c@@ key operations needs to be perfectly aligned with that of the organization .
He must also have a say in the decisions that impact the team &apos;s performance .
These conditions are not currently met .
S@@ ak@@ ic , who hi@@ red Ro@@ y on May 23 , 2013 , than@@ ked Ro@@ y for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Pat@@ ric@@ k informed me of his decision today , &quot; S@@ ak@@ ic said .
We appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best of luck in the future .
Ro@@ y was named the J@@ ack A@@ dams A@@ ward winner as the le@@ ague &apos;s best co@@ ach during his roo@@ ki@@ e season with the A@@ val@@ anch@@ e in 201@@ 3-@@ 14 .
He guided the club to 11@@ 2 points and a first-@@ place finish in the Central Di@@ vision , but Col@@ or@@ ado was up@@ set by Min@@ ne@@ so@@ ta in the first round of the pla@@ y@@ offs and has missed the post@@ season in each of the last two years .
The A@@ val@@ anch@@ e po@@ sted a 3@@ 9-@@ 3@@ 9-@@ 4 mark in 201@@ 5-@@ 16 and fell five points shy of the Wil@@ d for the second wil@@ d-@@ card spot in the Western Conference .

North Sea oil workers resume talks , susp@@ end strike
Labor strikes over pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks , lead negotiators said .
S@@ tri@@ kes against o@@ il@@ field services company Wo@@ od Group have been staged s@@ por@@ ad@@ ically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch S@@ hell .
&quot; Wo@@ od Group and the Un@@ ite and RM@@ T unions can confirm we have agreed to re@@ start the process for resolution of the current dispute , &quot; a joint statement read .
We will hold a number of full-@@ day meetings over the next few weeks , starting early next week , to take a fresh look at the issues .
The labor unions said their recent action , which they said is the first in more than 25 years , was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent .
Wo@@ od Group this year cut rates paid to its North Sea contrac@@ tors by about 9 percent because of negative market pressures .
The company &apos;s rate reduction follows a 10 percent decrease for on@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
The company said additional cuts would give the company the room needed to move through the market downturn .
S@@ hell , for its part , has tri@@ m@@ med thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it stream@@ lines its operations in the wake of its mega-@@ mer@@ ger with British energy company B@@ G Group .
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices , an economic situation compounded by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
Scottish M@@ ember of Parliament D@@ ave An@@ der@@ son met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes to strike the North Sea in a generation .
The North Sea , he said , is vital for the regional economy .
&quot; In the North Sea and right across the country , we need an economy that works for the many and not just the few , &quot; he said in a statement .
Less than $ 1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016 , compared with an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures spin rates of stars in P@@ le@@ i@@ ades clu@@ ster
The latest mission by the Ke@@ pler space tele@@ scope has helped astr@@ onom@@ ers collect the most complete cat@@ alo@@ g of spin rates among the stars of the P@@ le@@ i@@ ades clu@@ ster .
The new data is helping astr@@ onom@@ ers understand why stars in the clu@@ ster spin at varying rates , as well as how ro@@ tation periods rel@@ ate to planet formation .
&quot; We hope that by comparing our results to other star clu@@ sters , we will learn more about the relationship between a star &apos;s mass , its age , and even the history of its solar system , &quot; Lu@@ is@@ a Re@@ bul@@ l , a research scientist at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infra@@ red Pro@@ cess@@ ing and Analy@@ sis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , said in a news release .
The P@@ le@@ i@@ ades clu@@ ster is situ@@ ated 4@@ 45 ligh@@ t-@@ years from Earth .
Many of the stars in the clu@@ ster are just now reaching adul@@ tho@@ od , having been born roughly 12@@ 5 million years ago .
They &apos;@@ re sp@@ inning as fast as they ever will .
At their peak spin rates , these mat@@ uring stars e@@ ject large amounts of st@@ ell@@ ar wind .
As these winds travel across the stars &apos; mag@@ ne@@ tic fields , they enact a bra@@ king effect on the stars .
As a star ages , its spin rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures each star &apos;s spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recogn@@ iz@@ able star@@ spots -@@ - like sun@@ spots .
The latest cat@@ alo@@ g of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars .
Re@@ bul@@ l li@@ k@@ ens the stars to d@@ anc@@ ers , larger ones p@@ ir@@ ou@@ e@@ tting more slowly than smaller ones .
&quot; In the &apos; bal@@ let &apos; of the P@@ le@@ i@@ ades , we see that slow ro@@ t@@ ators tend to be more massive , whereas the fastest ro@@ t@@ ators tend to be very light stars , &quot; said Re@@ bul@@ l .
Because the P@@ le@@ i@@ ades clu@@ ster is so close , it serves as an ideal co@@ sm@@ ic laboratory to compare st@@ ell@@ ar qualities with spin rates .
&quot; The P@@ le@@ i@@ ades star clu@@ ster provides an anchor for theoretical models of st@@ ell@@ ar ro@@ tation going both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Re@@ bul@@ l .
We still have a lot we want to learn about how , when and why stars slow their spin rates and hang up their &apos; dance sho@@ es , &apos; so to speak .
Re@@ bul@@ l and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of P@@ le@@ i@@ ades spin rates in three new papers , soon to be published in the A@@ str@@ onom@@ ical Journal .
According to Z@@ hen@@ g Ji@@ an@@ ju@@ n , the Management Sec@@ tion Chief of N@@ an@@ hu Park Water Area , the dee@@ pest point of the South L@@ ake is more than 10 meters deep . People who do not understand the situation of water are probably confronted with danger .
&quot; Although the N@@ an@@ hu Park rescue team is very professional , we still hope that the majority of rowing tourists can wear life jac@@ kets and stay away from illegal activities on the la@@ ke to play safely &quot; Z@@ hen@@ g Ji@@ an@@ ju@@ n said .
W@@ ai T@@ au T@@ su@@ en bo@@ asts a unique marine environment , with two leisure travel resources including natural eco@@ logy and cultural eco@@ logy .
&quot; However , several owners who bought the par@@ king sp@@ aces in the community feared that this would affect the price of their par@@ king sp@@ aces and doub@@ ted that others were sel@@ fish , so they had been plo@@ tting for bad things . This had shel@@ ved the par@@ king space transformation . &quot;
As for the question about when the swe@@ et pot@@ ato@@ es are introduced and by whom , there are still many different versions in the academic community .
In the current mainstream view , there are three major lines for the introduction of swe@@ et po@@ ta@@ to .
Among the three lines of introducing swe@@ et po@@ ta@@ to , the introduction by Chen Z@@ hen@@ long from Philipp@@ ine to Fu@@ zhou is the one with the greatest impact and largest communication .
Beijing Mun@@ ici@@ pal Social Management Office will soon carry out special inspec@@ tions on the use of unified recei@@ p@@ ts of social group membership fees .
In@@ spec@@ tion is divided into two categories , unit self-@@ examination and spot inspec@@ tion .
Re@@ lev@@ ant person in charge of the municipal association said , the scope of the inspec@@ tion covers social groups who received unified recei@@ p@@ ts of social group fees in the social mass organization between 2013 and 2015 .
&quot; The success of the Olympic Games is defined by people who share stories in social media , &quot; said the Rio Olympic Organiz@@ ing Committee while establishing the communication strategy of 2012 Olympic Games .
From the news reports of the Olympic Games , all media have made a lot of changes in the aspect of mode of transmission , product form , language style , news perspective and many other aspects .
It seems that the International Olympic Committee and the media practition@@ ers around the world will have to meet this round of challenges .
On August 11 , this is the last day for the open sale of Ever@@ bright Securities H shares . News went that the market response was not special for market of the previous two days . According to the plan , it will be listed on the Hong Kong Sto@@ ck Exchange on August 18 .
A domestic bro@@ ker@@ age analy@@ st said that the O@@ ri@@ ent Securities in Hong Kong did not enjoy a good foundation . Only its capital management business is its strength . It has many inherent problems compared with Bank of China International and CI@@ T@@ I@@ C Securities , etc .
Experts pointed out that with the return of the securities market to fl@@ at@@ ness , many bro@@ kers s@@ ag@@ ged this year in results . But the detailed situation of the listed companies is dependent on the detailed development of the corporate business and cannot be gener@@ alized .
After the introduction of the regulation of the new deal , Su@@ zhou will become the first second-@@ tier city to re@@ start the purchase restric@@ tion .
In addition to Su@@ zhou , other second-@@ tier cities including He@@ fe@@ i and N@@ anj@@ ing will also introduce the property market regulation and control policies .
Pri@@ or to this , He@@ fe@@ i has been the first to issue restrictions on lending policy . For people who have two su@@ ites in He@@ fe@@ i and have one housing loan not paid , they will be denied with the mortgage services from bank .
